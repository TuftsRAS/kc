* RESKC-1836:PD Hierarchy Parent Budget Print: 'Allocated Lab Expense' and
  * 'Calculation Methodology' are missing from multiple Budget Reports (when
  * parent created from proposal in unit with no LA rates, and a proposal in
  * unit with LA rates is linked to the parent)

  * For PD Hierarchy, when the Parent proposal is created from a proposal in
  * a Unit that does NOT have LA rates and then a proposal in a unit with LA
  * rates is linked to the Parent Proposal, the line for "Allocated Lab
  * Expense" that should appear under Other Direct Costs is not included in
  * the the following Budget Print Reports:
  * 1 Budget Costshare Summary Report
  * 2 Budget Cumulative Report
  * 4 Budget Summary Report
  * 7 Industrial Budget Report
  * Also, Lab Allocation is not being included in the Calculation
  * Methodology section on the following Budget Print Reports: (For the
  * parent budget, LA expenses should be listed appropriately as exclusions
  * from the IDC base. There should also be a separate Calculation
  * Methodology included for the Lab Allocation base itself.)
  * 2 Budget Cumulative Report
  * 4 Budget Summary Report
  * 7 Industrial Budget Report
  * These same PD Budget Print Reports had previously been fixed for the
same issue on non-hierarchy parent budget prints. The Jira's for those
  * fixes are linked below.
  * This is not a problem on the individual child LA-unit proposals in the
  * hierarchy when printed, only at the parent level.
  * Steps to reproduce in res-demo1:
  * A.	Create Child Proposal 1 and Parent Proposal:
  * In the Create Proposal screen enter/select:
  * Proposal Type: New
  * Lead Unit: IN-PED – Pediatrics (this is a Unit that does not have Lab
  * Allocation rates)
  * Activity Type: Research
  * Project Dates: 11/01/2016 – 10/31/2017
  * Project Title: <any>
  * Sponsor: NIH
  * Click the [Save and Continue] button
  * In the Key Personnel > Personnel section, add a PI to the Proposal
  * In the Budget section:
  * Add a Budget Version
  * In the Budget:
  * o	Personnel Costs > Project Personnel section, add Base Salary for the
  * PI
  * o	Personnel Costs > Assign Personnel to Periods section, click the
  * [Assign Personnel …] button and complete as follows:
  * 	Person: <PI>
  * 	Object Code: Faculty Salaries Tenured – On
  * 	Effort %: 10
  * 	Charged %: 10
  * 	Click [Assign to Period 1] 
  * 	Click the Details & Rate link for the Faculty Salaries Tenured – On
  * Object Code and review Rate Tab (you should see amounts for Employee
  * Benefits – Research Rate, and MTDC)
  * o	Save your budget and click the [Return to proposal] button
  * Back in the Proposal, click the Hierarchy link located in the Toolbar.
  * In the Hierarchy window:
  * Hierarchy Budget Type: Sub-Budget
  * Click the [Create Hierarchy] button. The Parent proposal will be created
  * – note the parent proposal number
  * Close out of the Proposal
  * B.	Create Child Proposal 2 and Link it to Parent Proposal created in A:
  * In the Create Proposal screen enter/select:
  * Proposal Type: New
  * Lead Unit: IN-CARD – Cardiology (this is a Unit that has Lab Allocation
  * rates)
  * Activity Type: Research
  * Project Dates: 11/01/2016 – 10/31/2017
  * Project Title: <any>
  * Sponsor: NIH
  * Click the [Save and Continue] button
  * In the Key Personnel > Personnel section, add a PI to the Proposal
  * In the Budget section:
  * Add a Budget Version
  * In the Budget:
  * o	Personnel Costs > Project Personnel section, add Base Salary for the
  * PI
  * o	Personnel Costs > Assign Personnel to Periods section, click the
  * [Assign Personnel …] button and complete as follows:
  * 	Person: <PI>
  * 	Object Code: Summer Faculty – On
  * 	Effort %: 10
  * 	Charged %: 10
  * 	Click [Assign to Period 1] 
  * 	Click the Details & Rate link for the Faculty Salaries Tenured – On
  * Object Code and review Rate Tab (you should see amounts for Employee
  * Benefits – Research Rate, EB on LA, LA-M&S, LA-Salaries, LA-Utilities,
  * Vaca on LA, and MTDC)
  * 	Click the Budget Versions link and select Print from the Actions:
  * •	Select the checkbox for the Budget Summary Report and click the
  * [Print] button. The PDF will generated. Note the following: 
  * o	‘Allocated Lab Expense’ line under Other Direct Cost
  * o	Calculation Methodology 
  * o	Save your budget and click the [Return to proposal] button
  * Back in the Proposal, click the Hierarchy link located in the Toolbar.
  * In the Hierarchy window:
  * Link Proposal: <enter Parent Proposal Number created in A>
  * Hierarchy Budget Type: Sub-Budget
  * Click the [Link this Child to a Parent] button.
  * Close out of the Child 2 Proposal
  * C.	Open the Parent Proposal and navigate to the Budget:
  * In the Personnel Costs > Assign Personnel to Periods section, click the
  * Details & Rate link for the Faculty Salaries Tenured – On Object Code
  * (this is from Child 1 Budget). In the Rates tab, you will notice that
  * all the amounts have synced from Child 1 Proposal
  * In the Personnel Costs > Assign Personnel to Periods section, click the
  * Details & Rate link for the Summer Faculty – On Object Code (this is
  * from Child 2 Budget). In the Rates tab, you will notice that all the
  * amounts have synced from Child 2 Proposal
  * Click the Budget Versions link and select Print from the Actions:
  * o	Select the checkbox for the Budget Summary Report and click the
  * [Print] button. The PDF will generated. The PDF will generated. Note the
  * following: 
  * 	‘Allocated Lab Expense’ line under Other Direct Cost is MISSING

* RESKC-1838: Fix hierarchy line item group conflict. (#2095)

  * When viewing personnel item Details & Rates, when the Default or Custom Group includes entries from multiple children, the Details & Rates only reflects the amounts from the child budget that created the parent. The info from the other personnel items are not reflected. (This seems to be happening in all hierarchy proposals - not just the ones with LA and non-LA units)
  * (Only if each child budget has separate Custom Group(s) they used for entering each of their shared person cost element types, then it shows correctly in the details & rates. Or, if there is a Default or Custom group (g/l or cost element) that contains only salaries from one child, and there are no personnel from the other children in that cost element/category, then it displays correctly.)  * Gayathri Athreya on Tue, 29 Nov 2016 14:05:59 -0700 [View Commit](../../commit/8031d630c496f35bd36bfcabfb427578284d9c29)

* RESKC-1586: Integration Test and fix. (#2018)

  * In a Proposal Hierarchy, If a non-lead child proposal has a PI which is different from the Parent PI, and that person has only one unit associated, then after linking to the hierarchy, syncing all from the parent and then running the data validations
  * Bug: The Data Validation is deleting that person's unit.
  * Turn Validation off and the unit is still not appearing. The unit is not deleted from the child proposal.
  * Workaround - user can manually re-add the unit at the parent and then the unit stays associated even after data validation is turned on.
  * Requirement
  * Hierarchy Proposal Investigator Units	The system shall display all of the units listed in any of the child proposals as associated with the Co-Investigators. - the parent proposal should update (even with sync) to show all co-I units from all child proposals
  * The proposal hierarchy summary should show the parent as updating with additional units from personnel on child proposals.
  * Technical Details:
  * ProposalDevelopmentKeyPersonsRule.processSaveKeyPersonBusinessRules() removes the lead unit from non-PIs. The validation shouldn't be causing a side-effect, but it is. What it's checking for is whether or not the person is listed as a PI. If they are not the PI, then it checks to see if any of the unit are listed as the lead unit and removes them. This covers the case when a PI is down-graded to a Co-I and should follow the new PI. However, this breaks on hierarchy sync because the PIs from the non-primary children become Co-Is on the parent. When we sync the people in the hierarchy, we should also be setting leadUnit = false on all of their associated units.

* RESKC-1263: Adding award post functionality.

  * User Story
  * As a user with the ability to Post an Award,
  * I need to be able to complete updates to an already existing award and then after that award is submitted and finalized, send those updates to the Financial API manually via a Post button. So that the Financial system shows the recent award changes.

  * 3.) change rates so that code performs a rate sync (had to change code to get his to happen, not sure how it happens via the app)
  * 4.) try to create a new budget.
  * 5.) get STE below.

* RESKC-1308: Fix IP to Award data feed. (#1723)

  * System is ignoring the parameter setting for All_Sponsor_Hierarchy_NIH_Multiple_PI = Y.
  * While it presents and allows the user to select PI/Multiple in IP and Award, and appears to add that participant, the person is not fully saved in the record.
  * Their section 'disappears' on the Contacts screen, but the validation for Credit Split persists if that feature is enabled.
  * Fix must resolve the following:
  * 1. IP should not ignore the All Sponsor PI Multiple parameter
  * 2. Award should not ignore the All Sponsor PI Multiple parameeter
  * 3. When IP fed as funding source to Award, system should not ignore PI Multiple.
  * 
  * In stage:
  * Award created and added IP *3284 as funding source which brings in 2 contacts: PI Maher and PI/Multi Majumdar.
  * Added required fields to save; added template.
  * Contacts screen: found Maher as PI, but Majumdar imports as a Key Person (SHOULD BE PI/Multiple).
  * Test 1: Actions > Submit - got validation error re: credit split not = 100.
  * Returned to Contacts: Majumdar was no longer visible on screen. Stuck - cancelled award.
  * Test 2: recreated the award with the same funding proposal.
  * On Contacts: DELETED Majumdar key person. Searched and added back as PI/Multiple. Saved,
  * Again - Majumdar info on Contact screen disappears.
  * Cannot submit award due to persistent validation error for credit split - so the person is still in the record.  * Gayathri Athreya on Thu, 5 May 2016 12:03:47 -0700 [View Commit](../../commit/40d827095a73765ae8f2cc0c0e18b1c8a41798ea)

* RESKC-1211: IRB and IACUC FYI process enhancement

  * Problem: IRB was not always easily able to keep track of all notify IRB (FYI) actions, because admin only needs to acknowledge. This does not support a process where IRB admins often need to go back and forth with PI/Dept Admin to get needed documentation.
  * Contributed Solution:
  * -Model a special routing for the FYI/ Notify IRB process to be similar to the amendment protocol process, except does not allow modification of the protocol itself other than notes and attachments.
  * -IRB can now obtain more information and even approve/disapprove action.
  * -Upon approve the attachments role into the notes and attachments history for tracking.
  * -Parameterized.
  * -IACUC is also addressed.
  * This enhancement was discussed and approved by the KCC IRB subcommittee in 05/2014. Foundation Jira is KRAFDBCK-10691. Also, was shared with the IACUC Subcommittee.

* RESKC-1279: Fix medusa for subaward. (#1690)

  * When viewing the Medusa tab from either an Award or IP when there is a linked Subaward, the incorrect Subaward Data is displayed and the "open subaward" button opens the wrong Subaward.
  * There are a few related JIRAs (774, 894, 743) but I do not see any that address the fact that the incorrect Subaward data is displayed and link is broken. This seems to only occur in Award and IP (in other modules incorrect ID is also displayed but link and info is correct).
  * This occurs in Test Drive 1604.28 and our local 1512 environment.
  * To duplicate this issue consistently. In the database, SUBAWARD_ID is actually a different value than Subaward ID in the application (Subaward ID in application = SUBAWARD_CODE in db). It appears as if Medusa tab for Award and IP display both values and the info displayed and open button are linked to the SUBAWARD_ID and not SUBAWARD_CODE in database.  * Gayathri Athreya on Mon, 25 Apr 2016 14:12:44 -0700 [View Commit](../../commit/d3d18780ecfc25c9a45a2fdd2d20be995f0b05fb)

* RESKC-1227: Multiple fixes for PHS398CoverPageSupplement 3.0.

  * 1. Multiple issues to correct with the Stem Cell question branch:
  * a. Question ID 5 are stem cells used, is a parent ALWAYS ask question, but is currently still a child of Question ID 3 (phase 3 clinical trial) and thus only renders if the user answers Y to ID 5. Please correct this so it Always presents.
  * b. Question ID 142 needs to be reverted to it's prior state (text and 20 answer limit) so it continues to support its appearance in the S2S Questionnaire. Kuali prior stem cell answer q is ID7; 142 was used by Legacy Coeus.
  * c. New Question ID 149 should assigned to manage the 200 answer response for listing the registration numbers of stem cell lines. ALSO; this question should only present if the answer to QID 6 = Y.
  * Stem Cell Question branch revised as follows:
  * ALWAYS ASK	5	Does the proposed project involve human embryonic stem cells?
  * IF YES	6	Can a specific stem cell line be referenced at this time? If stem cells will be used, but a specific line cannot be referenced at the time of application submission, include a statement that one from the registry will be used.

  * -Issue One Result: You should be able to select reviewers but they are not appearing as part of the submit screen unless you have selected a schedule.
  * -Expected: A schedule should not be required for selecting reviewers if the review type is exempt (or expedited). Expedited is behaving correctly.
  * Submit the protocol without the schedule
  * Then assign a reviewer via Assign Reviewers action
  * -Issue Two result: The review assignment is saved but the Review tab does not appear. See screen shot
  * -Expected: The protocol review tab should appear
  * Note: If you add a schedule via Modify Submission Request at this point, then the OLR tab will appear

Moved sorting the list from java to database. Added cache for holding amendements and renewals for each protocol for two minutes. Fixed jsp tags where it was calling getter of amendementRenewal in a loop unnecessarily. As part of this optimization, removed the section of displaying proposal summary for each amendment. User can always look at each amendments and renewal details by clicking on the link next to the summary and open entire protocol in a new window

##coeus-1603.22
* RESKC-904:Fixed obligated amounts datatype.

  * In the Award Budget, the user must budget to exactly match the Obligated Total in order to submit the budget.
  * Currently, the system displays the Obligated Total rounded to whole dollar values in several fields:
  * > in the Non-Personnel Budget Overview
  * > rebudget >  line item detail if cents were in original item.

  * In Res demo 1: Award 000295-00001
  * Award budget versions screen displays the actual Obligated 144,638.69
  * Non-Personnel Budget Overview displays 144,639
  * (my expenses were full dollar amounts, so I did not see the rounding in the obligated column in the line item detail, but I expect this to be consistent with MIT's report.)

  * Desired Result: NONE of the Obligated total fields in Award Budget should round: they should ALWAYS display the exact value as this is the target amount the users must reach.

  * In an example budget, the obligated amount from Version 1 in the first screenshot (MITKC 2231a) does not match the obligated amount in Version 2 in the second screen shot (MITKC 2231b)
  * Version 1  award budget non-personnel tab displays "1686.00" for obligated amount (ROUNDED)
  * Version 2 award budget non-personnel tab displays for obligated amt 1685.51. (Actual obligated amount)

  * Calculations are correct, display is wrong. There should NOT be rounding.

* RESKC-1008: Allow utf-8 characters for budget notes.

  * Steps to reproduce:
  * Create a proposal with basic info to save.
  * Create a new budget version - detailed or summary.
  * Go to Budget Notes.
  * In the Notes field, PASTE in some text from a MSWord doc with some special formatting like curly quotes, curly apostrophes, or em-dashes.
  * Immediately click Periods & Totals from the left navigation menu.
  * You will see the validation message here.
  * Select Budget version from top menu bar, select Actions > Mark Budget complete for this budget.
  * Close budget (by closing browser window if necessary).
  * Open proposal to edit. Go to Summary Submit screen. Select [Submit For Review]
  * Result: the validation error message appears.

  * DESIRED RESULTS:
  * 1. Eliminate the Error. Budget Notes are not utilized in S2S submissions where special text is a problem, so any entries should be allowed as long as they are compatible with the database. There is no need to validate this so strictly. Warn the user: "*Pasted in text may include formatting that will not appear, please use plain text or manually type in the notes. *"
  * 2. Alternative: reduce it to a warning.

* RESKC-1132: Fixed proposal development document when recalled.

  * Proposal Routed for approval and was Recalled before the Investigator approved.
  * When in the same session, the submit status changed to save and the document became editable, user navigated to the key personnel section, searched for and added a multi-pi. selected the person certifications and noticed that answers to questions were not editable.
  * Left proposal and searched for proposal in proposal search.
  * Can edit some areas of proposal persons (such as commons name) but cannot certify the newly added multipi. Document status shows as approval pending and submit screen shows as saved (not routing)
  * Route log shows that the initiator recalled the proposal
  * yet the proposal is not entirely editable and the document status is incorrectly approval pending
  * To reproduce:
  * Searched for Proposal enroute that was awaiting PI approval
  * Clicked Edit from Search Results
  * Went to Submit on left Nav
  * Recalled
  * added Recall reason
  * navigated to key persons
  * added key person to Multi PI role
  * Closed.
  * Searched for PD again

  * Awards copied that contain multiple award amount infos from a time and money document fail on initial save with the following error.
  * ```

  * ```
  * This was because the indexOfAwardAmountInfoToDisplay would get set during versioning/sequencing due to a lazy initializer. After the versioning the amount info list is truncated leaving the indexOfAmountInfoToDisplay at a much higher number than exists. Then the KNS view of the initial page would populate the awardAmountInfo list with new, uninitialized values. Attempting to save these new items would throw the exception above.

  * Need a new function for KRMs in all Namespaces to search for a custom data entry. We're imagining this could work in a similar manner to the Questionnaire Category.
  * For Parameters, user may need to specify the specific Custom Attribute ID and the Document Type Code so that the specific field in question can be searched.
*Needs to work for Comparison of Null and !=Null, *
  * Would be nice to work where it can reference specific Value also

* update auth bulk push to set limit=100000

  * This change will allow us to more gracefully convert to the new node base core-auth. In the future the bulk push will likely be changed to do specific queries for each user instead of bulk pulling down all users from core-auth as we are doing now.

* RESKC-1179: Fixed hierarchy org issue.

  * A user creates a proposal hierarchy with at least two proposals. The proposal is finalized and submitted for routing. User realizes that the budget entries mean that there should be "other organizations" listed. User recalls the proposal.
  * User navigates to the parent proposal and then to the organization section, other organization tab. User searches for and adds four organizations. Save and Continue and all seems fine, as soon as the user chooses another tab in the left navigation there is a STE.
  * User expects to see new organizations added, and be able to navigate normally with the ability to re-submit for review.
steps to reproduce
  * Hierarchy had been successfully created, routed, and then returned for revisions.
  * With PD Status of Revisions Requested, DLC user had gone into Parent to edit and add several "Other Organizations" in Organization and Location section at request of OSP Approver.
  * User successfully added 4 Other Organizations.
  * Then began getting Incident reports with every attempt at navigating in the PD while editing.
  * When opened with Edit on Basics > Proposal Details screen, any attempt at navigating results in an Incident report, even simply clicking Proposal Details (the same screen user is on).
  * NOTE - at parent, when user opens in View and navigates to the Organizations & Locations, the Applicant Organization and Performing Organization tabs are both blank. This is normally populated with data by default. Child proposals still have this filled with data.

* RESKC-1038: When attempting to add an Activity or modify Activity End date, user receives incorrect validation message if Activity End Date is later than Negotiation End Date.

  * Message says "Activity End Date must be the same or later than the Activity Start Date". This message is incorrect and only way to resolve is to fix Negotiation End Date or Activity End Date (not Activity Start Date). This affects "Complete" Negotiation docs.
  * Steps to Reproduce
  * 1. Open/Create and complete Negotiation doc (End Date listed).
  * 2. Add/Modify Activity with Activity End Date later than Negotiation End Date (but with Activity Start Date before Activity End Date)
  * 3. Validation will say that Activity Start date must be before Activity End Date, even though it already is.
  * 4. Extend Negotiation End Date or shorten Activity End date to fix error.
  * Expected: The system should be checking if the activity end date is >= to the activity start date and show the message "Activity End Date must be the same or later than the Activity Start Date" whenever that is not true. Activity dates should not run against the Negotiation Dates
  * It seems like the error message that is displaying is for another situation

* RESKC-1152: Added new KRMS functions for award, PD, IP and IRB

  * This contribution is a series of KRMS functions for use in a variety of modules as well as the code necessary to allow functions in IP to work properly.  That code was left out of IP and Subaward when KRMS was linked to those modules.

  * Included Functions:

  * IRB: Does the Protocol contain a specified participant type?:  This function takes a parameter that is the participant type code or label and then returns true if any members of that participant type are included in the protocol.

  * How many participants does Protocol have of Type(_)?: This function accepts a participating type code or description and then returns a number equal to the number of participants of that type listed in the protocol.  This allows the user to use a variety of comparison operands with this function such as > < or =.

  * Check Protocol has Amendment Section(_): This function checks to see if a certain section of the protocol is being modified by an amendment and then returns true if it is.  It accepts the application labels for the various amendment sections listed in the protocol amendment action panel.

  * Check Protocol has Funding Source with Sponsor Type(_): This accepts a sponsor type label or code and then returns true if a funding source of sponsor is listed with a sponsor of that type.  It does not check the sponsor on linked grants documents.

  * Check if Base Protocol has Last Approval Date: This function will return true if the base protocol associated with a given document has a "Last Approval Date" listed.

  * Check if Sponsor and Prime Sponsor are the same: This function will return true if the sponsor and prime sponsor in a document are the same.  This function is being submitted for PD, IP and Award.  This is to accommodate schools that do not want prime sponsor listed if there is not one.

  * Check if Award has a Comment Entered of Type(_): This function is setup for Award and accepts Comment Type Code.  If there is any text in that comment for the award document it will return true.  This is to accomodate schools that have KFS integration turned on and want to check for fields that are required for account setup, but not OOB Award setup before an award is finalized to minimize award correction.

  * Check if Award/IP has a special review with the specified type(_) This accepts a special review type code and will return true if the award/IP has a special review entry listed of that type.

  * Check if Property has changed since the previous award version(_) This award function accepts a Property name.  It will return true if that field has changed since the last version of the award.  This will accept any variable name that can be used by the Term Specification property system, but the variable doesn't have to be setup in advance as a property.  If there are certain values in an award that are not supposed to be changed by general staff this is a good way to catch data entry errors.

  * Check Previous Version has Property matching value(_,_): This award function accepts a property name that follows the same variable rules as the last function.  It also accepts a value.  If any previous version of the award has that value then it will return true.  At IU there are certain things the staff are not supposed to change once an award has been made active.  They have more leeway to make changes while an award is in pre-award expenditure or pending status.  This allowed us to build validations based on those fields.  We specifically didn't hard code this to those fields so it could be flexible for other schools to utilize for other purposes.

  * Check if IP has a fiscal month the same as the current fiscal month: This will return true if the fiscal month is the same as the one listed on the IP.  This basically checks to see if the IP was finalized in a previous fiscal month.  This was necessary to prevent the alteration of certain data in historic records.

* RESKC-1166: A person entered as Multi-PI on an proposal or institute proposal is not being brought forward when funded to an award. All Key Personnel listed on Proposal should populate on an initiated institute proposal, and all personnel on an institutional proposal should populate on a linked award. The person in the Multi-PI role is currently dropped from award completely. They must still appear with the same role as from institutional proposal.

            *steps to reproduce*
            Create an Ip
            Add a PI and  a Multi PI,
            Complete the other fields required to submit
            Start a new award
            Link to the previous IP
            Complete fields required to save
            Navigate to the Award Contacts.
            Notice not all award contacts appear, since the Multi-pi is not there.

* RESKC-1162, Proposal Hierarchy does not delete personnel attachment from parent, Sync on non-employee personnel attachments cause an STE, In the Personnel Attachments Screen, when the User adds Personnel and their corresponding attachments, then clicks Save, the Personnel name disappears.

  * Steps to reproduce RESKC-1162:
  * 1) create a proposal.
  * 2) add two persons
  * 3) add a biosketch attachment for each person (two in total)
  * 4) save
  * 5) add budget
  * 6) return to proposal
  * 7) create sub budget hierarchy
  * 8) close child, open parent, confirm the two biosketch attachments exist on the parent
  * 9) close parent, open child
  * 10) delete one biosketch attachment
  * 11) save
  * 12) sync to parent
  * 13) close child, open parent
  * you will notice the parent still has two biosketch attachments even though it should only have one attachment.

  * Steps to reproduce 
  * 1) add non employee Key Person to a child in a hierarchy, save
  * 2) sync to parent
  * 3) close child
  * 4) open parent
  * 5) confirm the Key Person is listed at the parent
  * 6) close parent
  * 7) open child
  * 8) add a biosketch attachments for this KP at the child, save
  * 9) either:  sync to parent
  * STE 1 results.
  * OR close child. open parent. Sync All from parent.
  * STE 2 Results
  * you will notice both attachments are still on the parent.

  * Steps to reproduce 
  * To reproduce:
  * Create a proposal, or find one that is In Progress to edit.
  * if new proposal, enter the required fields to save.
  * Navigate to Key Personnel screen.
  * if new proposal, add personnel, and search for an Employee and add them as PI
  * Click Add Personnel> click 'Non Employee' to search the Address Book
  * locate and add the address book person as a co-investigator
  * Navigate to Attachments,
  * Select Personnel tab> Click Add
  * Choose the Address book Person from dropdown list
  * Add File and Description
  * At this point the name will be visible in the list of Personnel (FIG 1)
  * Click Save and the names disappear. (FIG 2)

  * Other issues also fixed:

  * 1) when a duplicate personnel attachment exists across child proposals, syncing from the parent will cause the duplicates to show up on the parent. Syncing from a child will filter out the duplicates. This is now corrected.
  * 2) non employee personnel attachments do not show the proposal person name
  * 3) non employee personnel attachments do not allow edits on the parent when duplicates exist on children. This differs from how employee personnel attachments work when duplicates exist on children.
  * 4) non employee personnel attachments can be added and maintained at the parent even when duplicates do not exist
  * 5) when a duplicate personnel attachment exists across child proposals, the child attachments should not be editable. This is correct exception the description textarea is still editable

* RESKC-1145: Added fringe totals to exclusion list when Overhead not applied.
  * In KC budget, in the line item details (both in Non-Personnel Costs and SPE screens) or personnel group Details & Rates, if you uncheck the "Apply Rate" box for MTDC, the IDC in the budget is correctly adjusted to exclude the unchecked amounts.
  * However, when you print the budget forms, the calculated fringe amount is not listed in the Page 2: Calculation Methodology: exclusions. When Personnel expenses use the 'unapply rate' option, the _salary _is listed as excluded, but associated fringes are not there.
  * The correct BASE does appear in the next section (F&A Cost Rates and Base), and is correct Page 1.
  * But a user should be able to manually calculate the Base by subtracting the Total exclusions from the F&A Base from the Total Direct Costs. We cannot get to this value the way the report prints today.
  * Steps to reproduce:
  * Create a budget for a research proposal
  * Add a Personnel, and assign them to the period.
  * Once added, click Details & Rates to open that window. Click on the Rates tab and uncheck the "Apply" box for MTDC. Save.
  * Save ( you can autogenerate periods or just review P1)
  * Toolbar > Budget Versions > Print > #4 Budget Summary Report > Create PDF.
  * ON p2 in the methodology - review the total exclusions to F&A.
  * Notice: the salary row appears in the list exclusions, but the calculated fringe does not.
  * Subtract that Total Exclusions value from the Total Direct Costs on P1.
  * Review the F&A Base in the next section on the form: it does not match your calculated amount.

* RESKC-1156:Fix STE when importing hierarchy proposal budget into award

  * When importing line items into an award budget from a hierarchy proposal a STE was generated due to it attempting to retreive rates from the original child proposal.
  * Hierarchy proposal number is now stripped from the line items during import as that information is no longer applicable.

* RESKC-489: Fixed prop person bio sync- fixed biography number and created new bio instead of deep copy.

  * STEPS TO RECREATE:
  * Create a PD with a PI (employee search) and a Key Person (employee search) with KP role "Subaward Investigator"
  * Go to Attachments > Personnel.
  * Upload a biosketch attachment for the PI and one for the KP.
  * Save.
  * From top action bar, go to Hierarchy. Select Sub-budget and Create Hierarchy.
  * Note the Parent number.
  * Save and close PD.
  * Both the parent and the child will have a PI with a biosketch and a Key Person with a biosketch.
  * Open PD Child again to edit.
  * In Personnel, add a second Key Person – using Non-Employee/Address book, KP Role "Subaward Investigator."
  * Do NOT upload a biosketch.
  * Save
  * From top action bar, go to Hierarchy. Select Sync to Hierarchy.
ste will result.

  * Return to Award
  * Award Budget > try to create a new award budget (2 posted versions already exist)
  * RESULTS: Cannot create a new award budget: error condition:

  * System must allow a user to create an award budget even when the dates and/or funding levels in prior versions are less than values that existed in prior versions. AKA Deobligated levels.
  * This deobligation can happen because a sponsor reduces funds/time from an entire project, or because a PI wants to reduce funds/effort in one project and move it to another.

* RESKC-701: Creating notification when proposal approved.
  * If I am one of several approvers at a routing stop where only one approval is required, (need the system to check if the peopleflow map stop is set to all or first and only perform notification if first) I need to be notified if another user has approved a proposal where I am either primary or alternate.
  * Currently, there is no notification available to provide this service. This means users have to check every notice in their action list.
  * MIT Coeus notification engine provided this type of message and it is immensely important to the campus business process.
  * When a proposal is routing, it often routes to a People Flow (routing map) containing a Primary Approver and at least one Secondary Approver. When someone on the People Flow approves the proposal, an email notification to the Other Approvers listed on the People Flow (but who did not approve the proposal) should be sent to let them know this proposal was already approved. This email notification should not be sent to the Approver who approved the proposal.
  * The email notification subject line should contain a subject line "Proposal _____ Approved by Other User", and the information in the email should contain the Proposal #, PI Name, Unit Name, and Proposal Title.
  * Please execute this in the notification service so that the message body can be changes and implementers can choose if the message is active and or requires a prompt window at action or approved by another

* RESKC-671: Adding ability to change proposal person role after addition. Cannot reproduce the STE mentioned so added test to verify.
  * Duplicated in res-test1.
  * Created initiating child proposal #6379 with PI user rhanlon
  * Created parent #6380. Using Summary/submit screen, confirmed rhanlon was PI in both parent and child.
  * Key Persons> deleted rhanlon as PI, searched and added Eagle as PI.
  * Synced to parent.
  * On Summary/Submit screen: Eagle was listed as Co-i on Parent proposal, and PI on child.
  * Using the Toolbar> Hierarchy> I tried to unlink the proposal from the parent. I got an STE. see comments.
  * In a Proposal Hierarchy, the PI on the Child proposal that creates the Parent proposal, becomes the lead PI on the Parent proposal. However, if after creating the Parent proposal, the PI changes and the user goes to the Child Proposal and changes the PI there first and syncs the change to the Parent proposal. The 'old' PI is removed (or role is modified - depending on the change made) from the Parent proposal BUT the new PI that was designated, synced as a Co-Investigator to the Parent proposal. This resulted in the Parent not having a PI - no matter what the user did (everyone appeared as a Co-Investigator or Key Person). We tried deleting and adding people back in and syncing and nothing work.
  * This happened in Production last week - DBA had to change the Role assignment for the PI in the Database.
  * Desired Behavior: If there is a PI change on the Child proposal that created the Parent proposal, the system should sync that change to the Parent proposal - assigning the PI role and NOT as Co-Investigator on the Parent proposal.
  * WORK AROUND: Create a new parent from the corrected lead child proposal.
  * Steps to Reproduce:
  * 1.    Create a Proposal (with minimum info to save)
  * 2.    Add a PI in the Key Personnel section
  * 3.    Create/add Budget (no need to add any costs - budget just needs to be initiated to create/link hierarchy)
  * 4.    In the Budget, click the Return to proposal button
  * 5.    In the Proposal, click the Hierarchy link in the toolbar. In the Hierarchy window select:
  * a.    Hierarchy Budget Type: Sub Budget
  * b.    Click the Create Hierarchy button
  * c.    Note the Parent Proposal number generated
  * d.    Close out of your proposal
  * 6.    Go to the Parent Proposal and navigate to the Key Personnel section. You should see the Person you designed as the PI in your Child proposal, appear as the PI in your Parent proposal
  * 7.    Close out of the Parent proposal
  * 8.    Navigate back to your Child Proposal and go to the Key Personnel Section
  * 9.    In the Key Personnel Section, delete the current PI
  * 10.   Add a different person as the new PI and save
  * 11.   Click the Hierarchy (C) link in the toolbar. In the Hierarchy window:
  * a.    Click the Sync Hierarchy button. (You should get a Synchronization successful message)
  * 12.   Navigate to the Parent Proposal -> Key Personnel section

* RESKC-1097: In Proposal Dev, Proposal Hierarchy Parent Budget cost share lines are being duplicated in Institutional Commitments.

  * In Proposal Dev, Proposal Hierarchy Parent Budget cost share lines are being duplicated in Institutional Commitments > Cost Sharing when the Hierarchy > Sync All action is taken at the parent budget level.

  * Each time the sync is performed, additional lines are pulled into the distribution screen, rather than the existing ones being updated (or all deleted then written anew from the child budgets upon sync).

  * This does NOT happen when the Budget > Hierarchy > Sync to parent action is taken from an individual child. However, there are scenarios when it is not feasible to sync individually from each child rather than from the parent, particularly when children are from different units with different aggregators.

*Desired result:*
  * Syncing All from Hierarchy Parent Budget should not add new rows to those already existing at the parent budget Commitments - Cost Sharing.
  * Sync All from Parent Budget should remove all existing rows replace with the current rows from each child proposal budget with cost sharing commitments entered.

  * Steps to reproduce:

  * Create a 2 year proposal with basic information
  * Key person: PI
  * Create a Budget: add non-personnel line item at $1000, in Details, add same $1000 amount in the Cost Sharing field. Unclick the "Apply Inflation" for the line item.
  * Autogenerate periods.
  * On Commitments > Cost Sharing, enter source account as "1234567" in a row for each year for the $1000 direct costs; leave unit number blank and percentage at 0% (MIT does not usually use).
  * Add an additional row for each period for the F&A amount ($5,600 at in MIT KC WKLy): enter source account as 1402600 (all MIT uses this account for Cost Sharing F&A); leave unit number blank and percentage at 0%
  * Complete the budget.
  * Return to the proposal >
  * Toolbar > Hierarchy > create a parent with this proposal as sub-budget. Make note of the parent proposal number.
  * Toolbar > Copy > copy this proposal including the budget.

  * In the new proposal > toolbar > budget versions >Open the budget.
  * In the cost sharing distribution, change the source account for the direct costs lines for each year to "7654321".
  * Save and mark the budget as for submission and complete. (it is identical to first proposal, except for the Cost sharing direct cost source code).
  * Make a note of this child #2 proposal number.
  * Save and close proposal.

  * Open the Parent proposal .
  * Proposal Details > Toolbar > Hierarchy >  select sub-budget, enter second child proposal number and click Link a child to this Parent> Link a child to this Parent.
  * Open Budget.
  * Note Cost Sharing total by year in Periods and Totals.
  * Go to Commitments > Cost Sharing > Summary. Ensure same as the P&T amounts.
  * Note number of lines in distribution.

* RESKC-1095:PD Budget: new validation to enforce Proposal and Budget Start/End dates breaks several business processes

  * The current fix does not allow the flexibility needed for different types of proposal submissions to comply with sponsor requested preparation (e.g. supplement proposals where the entire project period is to be entered in the proposal but the budget is to include on the start and end date covering the supplemental funds spending), or for syncing child proposal budget date changes to a hierarchy.

  * The validation needs to be changed from requiring budget start and end dates to match the proposal start and end dates to instead enforcing that the budget start date falls after the proposal start date and the budget end date falls before the proposal period end date.
  * The budget start and end dates must both fall within the project period, rather than match exactly.

  * The field for subrecpient's display of name was not large enough to accomodate the DUNS as well. Therefore, we should move that field to the bottom of the section so that the area can expand to show the DUNS and subrecipient name in one location. This would seperate the Subrecipient from the Sub Investigator however, so we also require that the sub Investigator move to be directly above the new subrecipient display placement. To do that, we will move the execution date to the former placement of the subrecipient.

* PD - COI Disclosure Status button and Window should display if logic requires certification

  * This is a business process requirement.
  * The COI Disclosure status button and window should display if any and all logic triggers the requirement for any proposal person to certify (sponsor hierarchy, PCK flag, proposal types, etc).
  * The button should display when personnel are added to the proposal.
  * When opened the window should remain unpopulated unless and until a proposal person answers with a Yes to one of the COI screening questions in proposal certifications maintained in PROP_PERSON_COI_CERTIFY_QID.

  * Currently the COI Disclosure status button will not display until a person has answered a yes to one of the COI screening questions in proposal certifications. Showing no COI Disclosure Status button is confusing as could mean no requirement for certification by logic or by a persons answers. The window should display if logic requires certification by any proposal persons.

##coeus-1601.1
* IP & Award: System is allowing users to edit prior document versions when a later version of the document exists.

  * The system is allowing users to edit prior Institutional and Award document Versions but it does not pull in the data from the latest finalized version.

  * For example, in the Institutional Proposal module, if I edit an IP record - the correct Version number gets assigned regardless of what version I click the [edit] button in. However, I noticed that the information in the newly created version pulls in from the IP version I have clicked the [edit] button in and NOT from the latest finalized IP version that exists. (SAME IS HAPPENING IN THE AWARD).

  * For example, let's assume I have an IP that has a latest finalized Version 3 with title 'Kat - Version 3'. I edit that version to create Version 4 with title 'Kat - Version 4' and finalize that. I then go back to Version 3 and I edit that version, KC will assign the correct Version number (Version 5), however, the title that will pull in will be 'Kat - Version 3' and not 'Kat - Version 4'.

  * If a user jots down a doc number – they won’t look to see if a later version exists so we will run into wrong data being pulled into the IPs and Awards. To avoid this problem, the system should only allow users to EDIT the LATEST FINALIZED VERSION. Prior document versions should NOT have an [edit] button.

* RESKC-1836:PD Hierarchy Parent Budget Print: 'Allocated Lab Expense' and
  * 'Calculation Methodology' are missing from multiple Budget Reports (when
  * parent created from proposal in unit with no LA rates, and a proposal in
  * unit with LA rates is linked to the parent)

  * For PD Hierarchy, when the Parent proposal is created from a proposal in
  * a Unit that does NOT have LA rates and then a proposal in a unit with LA
  * rates is linked to the Parent Proposal, the line for "Allocated Lab
  * Expense" that should appear under Other Direct Costs is not included in
  * the the following Budget Print Reports:
  * 1 Budget Costshare Summary Report
  * 2 Budget Cumulative Report
  * 4 Budget Summary Report
  * 7 Industrial Budget Report
  * Also, Lab Allocation is not being included in the Calculation
  * Methodology section on the following Budget Print Reports: (For the
  * parent budget, LA expenses should be listed appropriately as exclusions
  * from the IDC base. There should also be a separate Calculation
  * Methodology included for the Lab Allocation base itself.)
  * 2 Budget Cumulative Report
  * 4 Budget Summary Report
  * 7 Industrial Budget Report
  * These same PD Budget Print Reports had previously been fixed for the
same issue on non-hierarchy parent budget prints. The Jira's for those
  * fixes are linked below.
  * This is not a problem on the individual child LA-unit proposals in the
  * hierarchy when printed, only at the parent level.
  * Steps to reproduce in res-demo1:
  * A.	Create Child Proposal 1 and Parent Proposal:
  * In the Create Proposal screen enter/select:
  * Proposal Type: New
  * Lead Unit: IN-PED – Pediatrics (this is a Unit that does not have Lab
  * Allocation rates)
  * Activity Type: Research
  * Project Dates: 11/01/2016 – 10/31/2017
  * Project Title: <any>
  * Sponsor: NIH
  * Click the [Save and Continue] button
  * In the Key Personnel > Personnel section, add a PI to the Proposal
  * In the Budget section:
  * Add a Budget Version
  * In the Budget:
  * o	Personnel Costs > Project Personnel section, add Base Salary for the
  * PI
  * o	Personnel Costs > Assign Personnel to Periods section, click the
  * [Assign Personnel …] button and complete as follows:
  * 	Person: <PI>
  * 	Object Code: Faculty Salaries Tenured – On
  * 	Effort %: 10
  * 	Charged %: 10
  * 	Click [Assign to Period 1] 
  * 	Click the Details & Rate link for the Faculty Salaries Tenured – On
  * Object Code and review Rate Tab (you should see amounts for Employee
  * Benefits – Research Rate, and MTDC)
  * o	Save your budget and click the [Return to proposal] button
  * Back in the Proposal, click the Hierarchy link located in the Toolbar.
  * In the Hierarchy window:
  * Hierarchy Budget Type: Sub-Budget
  * Click the [Create Hierarchy] button. The Parent proposal will be created
  * – note the parent proposal number
  * Close out of the Proposal
  * B.	Create Child Proposal 2 and Link it to Parent Proposal created in A:
  * In the Create Proposal screen enter/select:
  * Proposal Type: New
  * Lead Unit: IN-CARD – Cardiology (this is a Unit that has Lab Allocation
  * rates)
  * Activity Type: Research
  * Project Dates: 11/01/2016 – 10/31/2017
  * Project Title: <any>
  * Sponsor: NIH
  * Click the [Save and Continue] button
  * In the Key Personnel > Personnel section, add a PI to the Proposal
  * In the Budget section:
  * Add a Budget Version
  * In the Budget:
  * o	Personnel Costs > Project Personnel section, add Base Salary for the
  * PI
  * o	Personnel Costs > Assign Personnel to Periods section, click the
  * [Assign Personnel …] button and complete as follows:
  * 	Person: <PI>
  * 	Object Code: Summer Faculty – On
  * 	Effort %: 10
  * 	Charged %: 10
  * 	Click [Assign to Period 1] 
  * 	Click the Details & Rate link for the Faculty Salaries Tenured – On
  * Object Code and review Rate Tab (you should see amounts for Employee
  * Benefits – Research Rate, EB on LA, LA-M&S, LA-Salaries, LA-Utilities,
  * Vaca on LA, and MTDC)
  * 	Click the Budget Versions link and select Print from the Actions:
  * •	Select the checkbox for the Budget Summary Report and click the
  * [Print] button. The PDF will generated. Note the following: 
  * o	‘Allocated Lab Expense’ line under Other Direct Cost
  * o	Calculation Methodology 
  * o	Save your budget and click the [Return to proposal] button
  * Back in the Proposal, click the Hierarchy link located in the Toolbar.
  * In the Hierarchy window:
  * Link Proposal: <enter Parent Proposal Number created in A>
  * Hierarchy Budget Type: Sub-Budget
  * Click the [Link this Child to a Parent] button.
  * Close out of the Child 2 Proposal
  * C.	Open the Parent Proposal and navigate to the Budget:
  * In the Personnel Costs > Assign Personnel to Periods section, click the
  * Details & Rate link for the Faculty Salaries Tenured – On Object Code
  * (this is from Child 1 Budget). In the Rates tab, you will notice that
  * all the amounts have synced from Child 1 Proposal
  * In the Personnel Costs > Assign Personnel to Periods section, click the
  * Details & Rate link for the Summer Faculty – On Object Code (this is
  * from Child 2 Budget). In the Rates tab, you will notice that all the

* RESKC-1838: Fix hierarchy line item group conflict. (#2095)

  * When viewing personnel item Details & Rates, when the Default or Custom Group includes entries from multiple children, the Details & Rates only reflects the amounts from the child budget that created the parent. The info from the other personnel items are not reflected. (This seems to be happening in all hierarchy proposals - not just the ones with LA and non-LA units)
  * (Only if each child budget has separate Custom Group(s) they used for entering each of their shared person cost element types, then it shows correctly in the details & rates. Or, if there is a Default or Custom group (g/l or cost element) that contains only salaries from one child, and there are no personnel from the other children in that cost element/category, then it displays correctly.)  * Gayathri Athreya on Tue, 29 Nov 2016 14:05:59 -0700 [View Commit](../../commit/8031d630c496f35bd36bfcabfb427578284d9c29)

##coeus-1610.0021
* RESKC-1586: Integration Test and fix. (#2018)

  * In a Proposal Hierarchy, If a non-lead child proposal has a PI which is different from the Parent PI, and that person has only one unit associated, then after linking to the hierarchy, syncing all from the parent and then running the data validations
  * Bug: The Data Validation is deleting that person's unit.
  * Turn Validation off and the unit is still not appearing. The unit is not deleted from the child proposal.
  * Workaround - user can manually re-add the unit at the parent and then the unit stays associated even after data validation is turned on.
  * Requirement
  * Hierarchy Proposal Investigator Units	The system shall display all of the units listed in any of the child proposals as associated with the Co-Investigators. - the parent proposal should update (even with sync) to show all co-I units from all child proposals
  * The proposal hierarchy summary should show the parent as updating with additional units from personnel on child proposals.
  * Technical Details:
  * ProposalDevelopmentKeyPersonsRule.processSaveKeyPersonBusinessRules() removes the lead unit from non-PIs. The validation shouldn't be causing a side-effect, but it is. What it's checking for is whether or not the person is listed as a PI. If they are not the PI, then it checks to see if any of the unit are listed as the lead unit and removes them. This covers the case when a PI is down-graded to a Co-I and should follow the new PI. However, this breaks on hierarchy sync because the PIs from the non-primary children become Co-Is on the parent. When we sync the people in the hierarchy, we should also be setting leadUnit = false on all of their associated units.

  * 3.) change rates so that code performs a rate sync (had to change code to get his to happen, not sure how it happens via the app)
  * 4.) try to create a new budget.
  * 5.) get STE below.

* RESKC-1308: Fix IP to Award data feed. (#1723)

  * System is ignoring the parameter setting for All_Sponsor_Hierarchy_NIH_Multiple_PI = Y.
  * While it presents and allows the user to select PI/Multiple in IP and Award, and appears to add that participant, the person is not fully saved in the record.
  * Their section 'disappears' on the Contacts screen, but the validation for Credit Split persists if that feature is enabled.
  * Fix must resolve the following:
  * 1. IP should not ignore the All Sponsor PI Multiple parameter
  * 2. Award should not ignore the All Sponsor PI Multiple parameeter
  * 3. When IP fed as funding source to Award, system should not ignore PI Multiple.
  * 
  * In stage:
  * Award created and added IP *3284 as funding source which brings in 2 contacts: PI Maher and PI/Multi Majumdar.
  * Added required fields to save; added template.
  * Contacts screen: found Maher as PI, but Majumdar imports as a Key Person (SHOULD BE PI/Multiple).
  * Test 1: Actions > Submit - got validation error re: credit split not = 100.
  * Returned to Contacts: Majumdar was no longer visible on screen. Stuck - cancelled award.
  * Test 2: recreated the award with the same funding proposal.
  * On Contacts: DELETED Majumdar key person. Searched and added back as PI/Multiple. Saved,
  * Again - Majumdar info on Contact screen disappears.
  * Cannot submit award due to persistent validation error for credit split - so the person is still in the record.  * Gayathri Athreya on Thu, 5 May 2016 12:03:47 -0700 [View Commit](../../commit/40d827095a73765ae8f2cc0c0e18b1c8a41798ea)

  * As a Negotiation Administrator, I only want active values to appear in the drop-down lists when I create or edit a negotiation so that I don't incorrectly select an inactive value.
  * 
  * Steps to recreate issue:
  * 1. System Admin Portal > Negotiations > Negotiation Activity Type (or Negotiation Location)
  * 2. Click to open the Lookup window
  * 3. Click on "Both" for the Active field to locate all values (active & inactive)
  * 4. Click search
  * 5. Note any that are Inactive (Active column = "No") and if all are Active, edit one to make it Inactive
  * 6. KRAD Porgal > Central Admin > Preaward > Negotations
  * 7. When in the Negotiation Document, click show on Activities & Attachments panel.
  * 8. Click Show to open the Add Activity.
  * 9. Click on the drop down for Activity Type (or Location)
  * RESULT: Inactive value is appearing in the drop-down list for Activity Type (or Location).
  * EXPECTED RESULT: Only active values should appear in drop-down lists.  * Travis Schneeberger on Fri, 29 Apr 2016 21:43:21 -0400 [View Commit](../../commit/067b4a8a8d1f30ccddb65154200fc62ba5dc1edb)
* RESKC-1211: IRB and IACUC FYI process enhancement

  * Problem: IRB was not always easily able to keep track of all notify IRB (FYI) actions, because admin only needs to acknowledge. This does not support a process where IRB admins often need to go back and forth with PI/Dept Admin to get needed documentation.
  * Contributed Solution:
  * -Model a special routing for the FYI/ Notify IRB process to be similar to the amendment protocol process, except does not allow modification of the protocol itself other than notes and attachments.
  * -IRB can now obtain more information and even approve/disapprove action.
  * -Upon approve the attachments role into the notes and attachments history for tracking.
  * -Parameterized.
  * -IACUC is also addressed.
  * This enhancement was discussed and approved by the KCC IRB subcommittee in 05/2014. Foundation Jira is KRAFDBCK-10691. Also, was shared with the IACUC Subcommittee.

* RESKC-1279: Fix medusa for subaward. (#1690)

  * When viewing the Medusa tab from either an Award or IP when there is a linked Subaward, the incorrect Subaward Data is displayed and the "open subaward" button opens the wrong Subaward.
  * There are a few related JIRAs (774, 894, 743) but I do not see any that address the fact that the incorrect Subaward data is displayed and link is broken. This seems to only occur in Award and IP (in other modules incorrect ID is also displayed but link and info is correct).
  * This occurs in Test Drive 1604.28 and our local 1512 environment.
  * To duplicate this issue consistently. In the database, SUBAWARD_ID is actually a different value than Subaward ID in the application (Subaward ID in application = SUBAWARD_CODE in db). It appears as if Medusa tab for Award and IP display both values and the info displayed and open button are linked to the SUBAWARD_ID and not SUBAWARD_CODE in database.  * Gayathri Athreya on Mon, 25 Apr 2016 14:12:44 -0700 [View Commit](../../commit/d3d18780ecfc25c9a45a2fdd2d20be995f0b05fb)

* RESKC-1165, RESKC-1048: Adding Coi disclosure status to IRB and IACUC protocol persons.

  * As a researcher or admin responsible for a protocol, I can see the COI disclosure status of project person to determine if the protocol can be approved as is or or if project personnel need to disclose to proceed.
  * General Acceptance Criteria:
  * Configurable in monolith so it is only displayed in a module if desired by the school.
  * For each project person, display the latest status of the annual disclosure that includes that project.
  * if the project is not on annual yet, display "Not yet disclosed"
  * if a project is not required to disclose display "Disclosure Not Required"
  * Acceptance Criteria:
  * Admin can configure IRB to link with new COI module
  * COI disclosure status for protocol project persons displays in IRB protocol based new module
  * Design: display "COI Disclosure Status: [status]" in Person header

  * -Issue One Result: You should be able to select reviewers but they are not appearing as part of the submit screen unless you have selected a schedule.
  * -Expected: A schedule should not be required for selecting reviewers if the review type is exempt (or expedited). Expedited is behaving correctly.
  * Submit the protocol without the schedule
  * Then assign a reviewer via Assign Reviewers action
  * -Issue Two result: The review assignment is saved but the Review tab does not appear. See screen shot
  * -Expected: The protocol review tab should appear
  * Note: If you add a schedule via Modify Submission Request at this point, then the OLR tab will appear

Moved sorting the list from java to database. Added cache for holding amendements and renewals for each protocol for two minutes. Fixed jsp tags where it was calling getter of amendementRenewal in a loop unnecessarily. As part of this optimization, removed the section of displaying proposal summary for each amendment.

* RESKC-904:Fixed obligated amounts datatype.

  * In the Award Budget, the user must budget to exactly match the Obligated Total in order to submit the budget.
  * Currently, the system displays the Obligated Total rounded to whole dollar values in several fields:
  * > in the Non-Personnel Budget Overview
  * > rebudget >  line item detail if cents were in original item.

  * In Res demo 1: Award 000295-00001
  * Award budget versions screen displays the actual Obligated 144,638.69
  * Non-Personnel Budget Overview displays 144,639
  * (my expenses were full dollar amounts, so I did not see the rounding in the obligated column in the line item detail, but I expect this to be consistent with MIT's report.)

  * Desired Result: NONE of the Obligated total fields in Award Budget should round: they should ALWAYS display the exact value as this is the target amount the users must reach.

  * In an example budget, the obligated amount from Version 1 in the first screenshot (MITKC 2231a) does not match the obligated amount in Version 2 in the second screen shot (MITKC 2231b)
  * Version 1  award budget non-personnel tab displays "1686.00" for obligated amount (ROUNDED)
  * Version 2 award budget non-personnel tab displays for obligated amt 1685.51. (Actual obligated amount)

  * Calculations are correct, display is wrong. There should NOT be rounding.

* RESKC-1008: Allow utf-8 characters for budget notes.

  * Steps to reproduce:
  * Create a proposal with basic info to save.
  * Create a new budget version - detailed or summary.
  * Go to Budget Notes.
  * In the Notes field, PASTE in some text from a MSWord doc with some special formatting like curly quotes, curly apostrophes, or em-dashes.
  * Immediately click Periods & Totals from the left navigation menu.
  * You will see the validation message here.
  * Select Budget version from top menu bar, select Actions > Mark Budget complete for this budget.
  * Close budget (by closing browser window if necessary).
  * Open proposal to edit. Go to Summary Submit screen. Select [Submit For Review]
  * Result: the validation error message appears.

  * DESIRED RESULTS:
  * 1. Eliminate the Error. Budget Notes are not utilized in S2S submissions where special text is a problem, so any entries should be allowed as long as they are compatible with the database. There is no need to validate this so strictly. Warn the user: "*Pasted in text may include formatting that will not appear, please use plain text or manually type in the notes. *"
  * 2. Alternative: reduce it to a warning.

  * When in the same session, the submit status changed to save and the document became editable, user navigated to the key personnel section, searched for and added a multi-pi. selected the person certifications and noticed that answers to questions were not editable.
  * Left proposal and searched for proposal in proposal search.

* Copied awards with multiple award amount info errors on save

  * Awards copied that contain multiple award amount infos from a time and money document fail on initial save with the following error.
  * ```
  * org.springframework.dao.DataIntegrityViolationException: OJB operation; SQL []; Column 'AWARD_NUMBER' cannot be null; nested exception is com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException: Column 'AWARD_NUMBER' cannot be null
  * ```
  * This was because the indexOfAwardAmountInfoToDisplay would get set during versioning/sequencing due to a lazy initializer. After the versioning the amount info list is truncated leaving the indexOfAmountInfoToDisplay at a much higher number than exists. Then the KNS view of the initial page would populate the awardAmountInfo list with new, uninitialized values. Attempting to save these new items would throw the exception above.

* RESKC-1179: Fixed hierarchy org issue.

  * A user creates a proposal hierarchy with at least two proposals. The proposal is finalized and submitted for routing. User realizes that the budget entries mean that there should be "other organizations" listed. User recalls the proposal.
  * User navigates to the parent proposal and then to the organization section, other organization tab. User searches for and adds four organizations. Save and Continue and all seems fine, as soon as the user chooses another tab in the left navigation there is a STE.
  * User expects to see new organizations added, and be able to navigate normally with the ability to re-submit for review.
steps to reproduce
  * Hierarchy had been successfully created, routed, and then returned for revisions.
  * With PD Status of Revisions Requested, DLC user had gone into Parent to edit and add several "Other Organizations" in Organization and Location section at request of OSP Approver.
  * User successfully added 4 Other Organizations.
  * Then began getting Incident reports with every attempt at navigating in the PD while editing.
  * When opened with Edit on Basics > Proposal Details screen, any attempt at navigating results in an Incident report, even simply clicking Proposal Details (the same screen user is on).
  * NOTE - at parent, when user opens in View and navigates to the Organizations & Locations, the Applicant Organization and Performing Organization tabs are both blank. This is normally populated with data by default. Child proposals still have this filled with data.

* RESKC-1038: When attempting to add an Activity or modify Activity End date, user receives incorrect validation message if Activity End Date is later than Negotiation End Date.

  * Message says "Activity End Date must be the same or later than the Activity Start Date". This message is incorrect and only way to resolve is to fix Negotiation End Date or Activity End Date (not Activity Start Date). This affects "Complete" Negotiation docs.
  * Steps to Reproduce
  * 1. Open/Create and complete Negotiation doc (End Date listed).
  * 2. Add/Modify Activity with Activity End Date later than Negotiation End Date (but with Activity Start Date before Activity End Date)
  * 3. Validation will say that Activity Start date must be before Activity End Date, even though it already is.
  * 4. Extend Negotiation End Date or shorten Activity End date to fix error.
  * Expected: The system should be checking if the activity end date is >= to the activity start date and show the message "Activity End Date must be the same or later than the Activity Start Date" whenever that is not true. Activity dates should not run against the Negotiation Dates
  * It seems like the error message that is displaying is for another situation

* RESKC-1152: Added new KRMS functions for award, PD, IP and IRB

  * This contribution is a series of KRMS functions for use in a variety of modules as well as the code necessary to allow functions in IP to work properly.  That code was left out of IP and Subaward when KRMS was linked to those modules.

  * Included Functions:

  * IRB: Does the Protocol contain a specified participant type?:  This function takes a parameter that is the participant type code or label and then returns true if any members of that participant type are included in the protocol.

  * How many participants does Protocol have of Type(_)?: This function accepts a participating type code or description and then returns a number equal to the number of participants of that type listed in the protocol.  This allows the user to use a variety of comparison operands with this function such as > < or =.

  * Check Protocol has Amendment Section(_): This function checks to see if a certain section of the protocol is being modified by an amendment and then returns true if it is.  It accepts the application labels for the various amendment sections listed in the protocol amendment action panel.

  * Check Protocol has Funding Source with Sponsor Type(_): This accepts a sponsor type label or code and then returns true if a funding source of sponsor is listed with a sponsor of that type.  It does not check the sponsor on linked grants documents.

  * Check if Base Protocol has Last Approval Date: This function will return true if the base protocol associated with a given document has a "Last Approval Date" listed.

  * Check if Sponsor and Prime Sponsor are the same: This function will return true if the sponsor and prime sponsor in a document are the same.  This function is being submitted for PD, IP and Award.  This is to accommodate schools that do not want prime sponsor listed if there is not one.

  * Check if Award has a Comment Entered of Type(_): This function is setup for Award and accepts Comment Type Code.  If there is any text in that comment for the award document it will return true.  This is to accomodate schools that have KFS integration turned on and want to check for fields that are required for account setup, but not OOB Award setup before an award is finalized to minimize award correction.

  * Check if Award/IP has a special review with the specified type(_) This accepts a special review type code and will return true if the award/IP has a special review entry listed of that type.

  * Check if Property has changed since the previous award version(_) This award function accepts a Property name.  It will return true if that field has changed since the last version of the award.  This will accept any variable name that can be used by the Term Specification property system, but the variable doesn't have to be setup in advance as a property.  If there are certain values in an award that are not supposed to be changed by general staff this is a good way to catch data entry errors.

  * Check Previous Version has Property matching value(_,_): This award function accepts a property name that follows the same variable rules as the last function.  It also accepts a value.  If any previous version of the award has that value then it will return true.  At IU there are certain things the staff are not supposed to change once an award has been made active.  They have more leeway to make changes while an award is in pre-award expenditure or pending status.  This allowed us to build validations based on those fields.  We specifically didn't hard code this to those fields so it could be flexible for other schools to utilize for other purposes.

  * Check if IP has a fiscal month the same as the current fiscal month: This will return true if the fiscal month is the same as the one listed on the IP.  This basically checks to see if the IP was finalized in a previous fiscal month.  This was necessary to prevent the alteration of certain data in historic records.

* RESKC-1166: A person entered as Multi-PI on an proposal or institute proposal is not being brought forward when funded to an award. All Key Personnel listed on Proposal should populate on an initiated institute proposal, and all personnel on an institutional proposal should populate on a linked award. The person in the Multi-PI role is currently dropped from award completely. They must still appear with the same role as from institutional proposal.

            *steps to reproduce*
            Create an Ip
            Add a PI and  a Multi PI,
            Complete the other fields required to submit
            Start a new award

            Navigate to the Award Contacts.
            Notice not all award contacts appear, since the Multi-pi is not there.

* RESKC-1162, Proposal Hierarchy does not delete personnel attachment from parent, Sync on non-employee personnel attachments cause an STE, In the Personnel Attachments Screen, when the User adds Personnel and their corresponding attachments, then clicks Save, the Personnel name disappears.

  * Steps to reproduce RESKC-1162:
  * 1) create a proposal.
  * 2) add two persons
  * 3) add a biosketch attachment for each person (two in total)
  * 4) save
  * 5) add budget
  * 6) return to proposal
  * 7) create sub budget hierarchy
  * 8) close child, open parent, confirm the two biosketch attachments exist on the parent
  * 9) close parent, open child
  * 10) delete one biosketch attachment
  * 11) save
  * 12) sync to parent
  * 13) close child, open parent
  * you will notice the parent still has two biosketch attachments even though it should only have one attachment.

  * Steps to reproduce 
  * 1) add non employee Key Person to a child in a hierarchy, save
  * 2) sync to parent
  * 3) close child
  * 4) open parent
  * 5) confirm the Key Person is listed at the parent
  * 6) close parent
  * 7) open child
  * 8) add a biosketch attachments for this KP at the child, save
  * 9) either:  sync to parent
  * STE 1 results.
  * OR close child. open parent. Sync All from parent.
  * STE 2 Results
  * you will notice both attachments are still on the parent.

  * Steps to reproduce 
  * To reproduce:
  * Create a proposal, or find one that is In Progress to edit.
  * if new proposal, enter the required fields to save.
  * Navigate to Key Personnel screen.
  * if new proposal, add personnel, and search for an Employee and add them as PI
  * Click Add Personnel> click 'Non Employee' to search the Address Book
  * locate and add the address book person as a co-investigator
  * Navigate to Attachments,
  * Select Personnel tab> Click Add
  * Choose the Address book Person from dropdown list
  * Add File and Description
  * At this point the name will be visible in the list of Personnel (FIG 1)
  * Click Save and the names disappear. (FIG 2)

  * Other issues also fixed:

  * 1) when a duplicate personnel attachment exists across child proposals, syncing from the parent will cause the duplicates to show up on the parent. Syncing from a child will filter out the duplicates. This is now corrected.
  * 2) non employee personnel attachments do not show the proposal person name
  * 3) non employee personnel attachments do not allow edits on the parent when duplicates exist on children. This differs from how employee personnel attachments work when duplicates exist on children.
  * 4) non employee personnel attachments can be added and maintained at the parent even when duplicates do not exist
  * 5) when a duplicate personnel attachment exists across child proposals, the child attachments should not be editable. This is correct exception the description textarea is still editable

* RESKC-1145: Added fringe totals to exclusion list when Overhead not applied.
  * In KC budget, in the line item details (both in Non-Personnel Costs and SPE screens) or personnel group Details & Rates, if you uncheck the "Apply Rate" box for MTDC, the IDC in the budget is correctly adjusted to exclude the unchecked amounts.
  * However, when you print the budget forms, the calculated fringe amount is not listed in the Page 2: Calculation Methodology: exclusions. When Personnel expenses use the 'unapply rate' option, the _salary _is listed as excluded, but associated fringes are not there.
  * The correct BASE does appear in the next section (F&A Cost Rates and Base), and is correct Page 1.
  * But a user should be able to manually calculate the Base by subtracting the Total exclusions from the F&A Base from the Total Direct Costs. We cannot get to this value the way the report prints today.
  * Steps to reproduce:
  * Create a budget for a research proposal
  * Add a Personnel, and assign them to the period.
  * Once added, click Details & Rates to open that window. Click on the Rates tab and uncheck the "Apply" box for MTDC. Save.
  * Save ( you can autogenerate periods or just review P1)
  * Toolbar > Budget Versions > Print > #4 Budget Summary Report > Create PDF.
  * ON p2 in the methodology - review the total exclusions to F&A.
  * Notice: the salary row appears in the list exclusions, but the calculated fringe does not.
  * Subtract that Total Exclusions value from the Total Direct Costs on P1.
  * Review the F&A Base in the next section on the form: it does not match your calculated amount.

  * On Summary/Submit screen: Eagle was listed as Co-i on Parent proposal, and PI on child.
  * Using the Toolbar> Hierarchy> I tried to unlink the proposal from the parent. I got an STE. see comments.
  * In a Proposal Hierarchy, the PI on the Child proposal that creates the Parent proposal, becomes the lead PI on the Parent proposal. However, if after creating the Parent proposal, the PI changes and the user goes to the Child Proposal and changes the PI there first and syncs the change to the Parent proposal. The 'old' PI is removed (or role is modified - depending on the change made) from the Parent proposal BUT the new PI that was designated, synced as a Co-Investigator to the Parent proposal. This resulted in the Parent not having a PI - no matter what the user did (everyone appeared as a Co-Investigator or Key Person). We tried deleting and adding people back in and syncing and nothing work.
  * This happened in Production last week - DBA had to change the Role assignment for the PI in the Database.
  * Desired Behavior: If there is a PI change on the Child proposal that created the Parent proposal, the system should sync that change to the Parent proposal - assigning the PI role and NOT as Co-Investigator on the Parent proposal.
  * WORK AROUND: Create a new parent from the corrected lead child proposal.
  * Steps to Reproduce:
  * 1.    Create a Proposal (with minimum info to save)
  * 2.    Add a PI in the Key Personnel section
  * 3.    Create/add Budget (no need to add any costs - budget just needs to be initiated to create/link hierarchy)
  * 4.    In the Budget, click the Return to proposal button
  * 5.    In the Proposal, click the Hierarchy link in the toolbar. In the Hierarchy window select:
  * a.    Hierarchy Budget Type: Sub Budget
  * b.    Click the Create Hierarchy button
  * c.    Note the Parent Proposal number generated
  * d.    Close out of your proposal
  * 6.    Go to the Parent Proposal and navigate to the Key Personnel section. You should see the Person you designed as the PI in your Child proposal, appear as the PI in your Parent proposal
  * 7.    Close out of the Parent proposal
  * 8.    Navigate back to your Child Proposal and go to the Key Personnel Section
  * 9.    In the Key Personnel Section, delete the current PI
  * 10.   Add a different person as the new PI and save
  * 11.   Click the Hierarchy (C) link in the toolbar. In the Hierarchy window:
  * a.    Click the Sync Hierarchy button. (You should get a Synchronization successful message)
  * 12.   Navigate to the Parent Proposal -> Key Personnel section
  * 13.   You will see that the old PI that you deleted from the Child proposal, was removed from the Parent proposal.
  * 14.   BUT the new Person you added to the child proposal as the new PI, synced to the Parent as a Co-Investigator. - see Parent Proposal Number 27528 in KC QA
  * (There is no way from this point on, to get someone to appear as the PI on that Parent Proposal. Other individuals from the any additional child proposals will automatically sync as Co-Investigators or Key Persons.)
  * The only work-around for this is to unlink and create a new Proposal Hierarchy with the correct PI or have the role assignment changed by DB Admin.
  * MITKC-2033

  * In Proposal Dev, Proposal Hierarchy Parent Budget cost share lines are being duplicated in Institutional Commitments > Cost Sharing when the Hierarchy > Sync All action is taken at the parent budget level.

  * Each time the sync is performed, additional lines are pulled into the distribution screen, rather than the existing ones being updated (or all deleted then written anew from the child budgets upon sync).

  * This does NOT happen when the Budget > Hierarchy > Sync to parent action is taken from an individual child. However, there are scenarios when it is not feasible to sync individually from each child rather than from the parent, particularly when children are from different units with different aggregators.

*Desired result:*
  * Syncing All from Hierarchy Parent Budget should not add new rows to those already existing at the parent budget Commitments - Cost Sharing.
  * Sync All from Parent Budget should remove all existing rows replace with the current rows from each child proposal budget with cost sharing commitments entered.

  * Steps to reproduce:

  * Create a 2 year proposal with basic information
  * Key person: PI
  * Create a Budget: add non-personnel line item at $1000, in Details, add same $1000 amount in the Cost Sharing field. Unclick the "Apply Inflation" for the line item.
  * Autogenerate periods.
  * On Commitments > Cost Sharing, enter source account as "1234567" in a row for each year for the $1000 direct costs; leave unit number blank and percentage at 0% (MIT does not usually use).
  * Add an additional row for each period for the F&A amount ($5,600 at in MIT KC WKLy): enter source account as 1402600 (all MIT uses this account for Cost Sharing F&A); leave unit number blank and percentage at 0%
  * Complete the budget.
  * Return to the proposal >
  * Toolbar > Hierarchy > create a parent with this proposal as sub-budget. Make note of the parent proposal number.
  * Toolbar > Copy > copy this proposal including the budget.

  * In the new proposal > toolbar > budget versions >Open the budget.
  * In the cost sharing distribution, change the source account for the direct costs lines for each year to "7654321".
  * Save and mark the budget as for submission and complete. (it is identical to first proposal, except for the Cost sharing direct cost source code).
  * Make a note of this child #2 proposal number.
  * Save and close proposal.

  * Open the Parent proposal .
  * Proposal Details > Toolbar > Hierarchy >  select sub-budget, enter second child proposal number and click Link a child to this Parent> Link a child to this Parent.
  * Open Budget.
  * Note Cost Sharing total by year in Periods and Totals.
  * Go to Commitments > Cost Sharing > Summary. Ensure same as the P&T amounts.
  * Note number of lines in distribution.
  * Still in budget -  Toolbar > Hierarchy >  Sync All.

  * Return to Commitments > Cost Sharing -- note that number of lines has increased, but Summary total has remained the same as have P&T total cost sharing.

  * Try to mark Budget Complete -- error regarding need to allocate all cost sharing funds will be received.

  * Turn on Validations - same error will be received.

  * Try Sync All again - it does not fix the problem but brings in yet more duplicate rows.

* RESKC-1095:PD Budget: new validation to enforce Proposal and Budget Start/End dates breaks several business processes

  * The current fix does not allow the flexibility needed for different types of proposal submissions to comply with sponsor requested preparation (e.g. supplement proposals where the entire project period is to be entered in the proposal but the budget is to include on the start and end date covering the supplemental funds spending), or for syncing child proposal budget date changes to a hierarchy.

  * The validation needs to be changed from requiring budget start and end dates to match the proposal start and end dates to instead enforcing that the budget start date falls after the proposal start date and the budget end date falls before the proposal period end date.
  * The budget start and end dates must both fall within the project period, rather than match exactly.

  * The field for subrecpient's display of name was not large enough to accomodate the DUNS as well. Therefore, we should move that field to the bottom of the section so that the area can expand to show the DUNS and subrecipient name in one location. This would seperate the Subrecipient from the Sub Investigator however, so we also require that the sub Investigator move to be directly above the new subrecipient display placement. To do that, we will move the execution date to the former placement of the subrecipient.

* PD - COI Disclosure Status button and Window should display if logic requires certification

  * This is a business process requirement.
  * The COI Disclosure status button and window should display if any and all logic triggers the requirement for any proposal person to certify (sponsor hierarchy, PCK flag, proposal types, etc).
  * The button should display when personnel are added to the proposal.
  * When opened the window should remain unpopulated unless and until a proposal person answers with a Yes to one of the COI screening questions in proposal certifications maintained in PROP_PERSON_COI_CERTIFY_QID.

  * Currently the COI Disclosure status button will not display until a person has answered a yes to one of the COI screening questions in proposal certifications. Showing no COI Disclosure Status button is confusing as could mean no requirement for certification by logic or by a persons answers. The window should display if logic requires certification by any proposal persons.

* RESKC-858: Program Code field limited to 4 characters. While this may be a correct validation for the NSF forms, the SF 424R&R allows up to 75 characters in Agency Routing Number field 4b where this data is mapping. The limit of 4 characters is an overly restrictive validation for the field in this usage.

##coeus-1601.1
* IP & Award: System is allowing users to edit prior document versions when a later version of the document exists.

  * The system is allowing users to edit prior Institutional and Award document Versions but it does not pull in the data from the latest finalized version.

  * For example, in the Institutional Proposal module, if I edit an IP record - the correct Version number gets assigned regardless of what version I click the [edit] button in. However, I noticed that the information in the newly created version pulls in from the IP version I have clicked the [edit] button in and NOT from the latest finalized IP version that exists. (SAME IS HAPPENING IN THE AWARD).

  * For example, let's assume I have an IP that has a latest finalized Version 3 with title 'Kat - Version 3'. I edit that version to create Version 4 with title 'Kat - Version 4' and finalize that. I then go back to Version 3 and I edit that version, KC will assign the correct Version number (Version 5), however, the title that will pull in will be 'Kat - Version 3' and not 'Kat - Version 4'.

  * If a user jots down a doc number – they won’t look to see if a later version exists so we will run into wrong data being pulled into the IPs and Awards. To avoid this problem, the system should only allow users to EDIT the LATEST FINALIZED VERSION. Prior document versions should NOT have an [edit] button.

* RESKC-1836:PD Hierarchy Parent Budget Print: 'Allocated Lab Expense' and
  * 'Calculation Methodology' are missing from multiple Budget Reports (when
  * parent created from proposal in unit with no LA rates, and a proposal in
  * unit with LA rates is linked to the parent)

  * For PD Hierarchy, when the Parent proposal is created from a proposal in
  * a Unit that does NOT have LA rates and then a proposal in a unit with LA
  * rates is linked to the Parent Proposal, the line for "Allocated Lab
  * Expense" that should appear under Other Direct Costs is not included in
  * the the following Budget Print Reports:
  * 1 Budget Costshare Summary Report
  * 2 Budget Cumulative Report
  * 4 Budget Summary Report
  * 7 Industrial Budget Report
  * Also, Lab Allocation is not being included in the Calculation
  * Methodology section on the following Budget Print Reports: (For the
  * parent budget, LA expenses should be listed appropriately as exclusions
  * from the IDC base. There should also be a separate Calculation
  * Methodology included for the Lab Allocation base itself.)
  * 2 Budget Cumulative Report
  * 4 Budget Summary Report
  * 7 Industrial Budget Report
  * These same PD Budget Print Reports had previously been fixed for the
same issue on non-hierarchy parent budget prints. The Jira's for those
  * fixes are linked below.
  * This is not a problem on the individual child LA-unit proposals in the
  * hierarchy when printed, only at the parent level.
  * Steps to reproduce in res-demo1:
  * A.	Create Child Proposal 1 and Parent Proposal:
  * In the Create Proposal screen enter/select:
  * Proposal Type: New
  * Lead Unit: IN-PED – Pediatrics (this is a Unit that does not have Lab
  * Allocation rates)
  * Activity Type: Research
  * Project Dates: 11/01/2016 – 10/31/2017
  * Project Title: <any>
  * Sponsor: NIH
  * Click the [Save and Continue] button
  * In the Key Personnel > Personnel section, add a PI to the Proposal
  * In the Budget section:
  * Add a Budget Version
  * In the Budget:
  * o	Personnel Costs > Project Personnel section, add Base Salary for the
  * PI
  * o	Personnel Costs > Assign Personnel to Periods section, click the
  * [Assign Personnel …] button and complete as follows:
  * 	Person: <PI>
  * 	Object Code: Faculty Salaries Tenured – On
  * 	Effort %: 10
  * 	Charged %: 10
  * 	Click [Assign to Period 1] 
  * 	Click the Details & Rate link for the Faculty Salaries Tenured – On
  * Object Code and review Rate Tab (you should see amounts for Employee
  * Benefits – Research Rate, and MTDC)
  * o	Save your budget and click the [Return to proposal] button
  * Back in the Proposal, click the Hierarchy link located in the Toolbar.
  * In the Hierarchy window:
  * Hierarchy Budget Type: Sub-Budget
  * Click the [Create Hierarchy] button. The Parent proposal will be created
  * – note the parent proposal number
  * Close out of the Proposal
  * B.	Create Child Proposal 2 and Link it to Parent Proposal created in A:
  * In the Create Proposal screen enter/select:
  * Proposal Type: New
  * Lead Unit: IN-CARD – Cardiology (this is a Unit that has Lab Allocation
  * rates)
  * Activity Type: Research
  * Project Dates: 11/01/2016 – 10/31/2017
  * Project Title: <any>
  * Sponsor: NIH
  * Click the [Save and Continue] button
  * In the Key Personnel > Personnel section, add a PI to the Proposal
  * In the Budget section:
  * Add a Budget Version
  * In the Budget:
  * o	Personnel Costs > Project Personnel section, add Base Salary for the
  * PI
  * o	Personnel Costs > Assign Personnel to Periods section, click the
  * [Assign Personnel …] button and complete as follows:
  * 	Person: <PI>
  * 	Object Code: Summer Faculty – On
  * 	Effort %: 10
  * 	Charged %: 10
  * 	Click [Assign to Period 1] 
  * 	Click the Details & Rate link for the Faculty Salaries Tenured – On
  * Object Code and review Rate Tab (you should see amounts for Employee
  * Benefits – Research Rate, EB on LA, LA-M&S, LA-Salaries, LA-Utilities,
  * Vaca on LA, and MTDC)
  * 	Click the Budget Versions link and select Print from the Actions:
  * •	Select the checkbox for the Budget Summary Report and click the
  * [Print] button. The PDF will generated. Note the following: 
  * o	‘Allocated Lab Expense’ line under Other Direct Cost
  * o	Calculation Methodology 
  * o	Save your budget and click the [Return to proposal] button
  * Back in the Proposal, click the Hierarchy link located in the Toolbar.
  * In the Hierarchy window:
  * Link Proposal: <enter Parent Proposal Number created in A>
  * Hierarchy Budget Type: Sub-Budget
  * Click the [Link this Child to a Parent] button.
  * Close out of the Child 2 Proposal
  * C.	Open the Parent Proposal and navigate to the Budget:
  * In the Personnel Costs > Assign Personnel to Periods section, click the
  * Details & Rate link for the Faculty Salaries Tenured – On Object Code
  * (this is from Child 1 Budget). In the Rates tab, you will notice that
  * all the amounts have synced from Child 1 Proposal

  * When viewing personnel item Details & Rates, when the Default or Custom Group includes entries from multiple children, the Details & Rates only reflects the amounts from the child budget that created the parent. The info from the other personnel items are not reflected. (This seems to be happening in all hierarchy proposals - not just the ones with LA and non-LA units)
  * (Only if each child budget has separate Custom Group(s) they used for entering each of their shared person cost element types, then it shows correctly in the details & rates. Or, if there is a Default or Custom group (g/l or cost element) that contains only salaries from one child, and there are no personnel from the other children in that cost element/category, then it displays correctly.)  * Gayathri Athreya on Tue, 29 Nov 2016 14:05:59 -0700 [View Commit](../../commit/8031d630c496f35bd36bfcabfb427578284d9c29)

* RESKC-1586: Integration Test and fix. (#2018)

  * In a Proposal Hierarchy, If a non-lead child proposal has a PI which is different from the Parent PI, and that person has only one unit associated, then after linking to the hierarchy, syncing all from the parent and then running the data validations
  * Bug: The Data Validation is deleting that person's unit.
  * Turn Validation off and the unit is still not appearing. The unit is not deleted from the child proposal.
  * Workaround - user can manually re-add the unit at the parent and then the unit stays associated even after data validation is turned on.
  * Requirement
  * Hierarchy Proposal Investigator Units	The system shall display all of the units listed in any of the child proposals as associated with the Co-Investigators. - the parent proposal should update (even with sync) to show all co-I units from all child proposals
  * The proposal hierarchy summary should show the parent as updating with additional units from personnel on child proposals.
  * Technical Details:
  * ProposalDevelopmentKeyPersonsRule.processSaveKeyPersonBusinessRules() removes the lead unit from non-PIs. The validation shouldn't be causing a side-effect, but it is. What it's checking for is whether or not the person is listed as a PI. If they are not the PI, then it checks to see if any of the unit are listed as the lead unit and removes them. This covers the case when a PI is down-graded to a Co-I and should follow the new PI. However, this breaks on hierarchy sync because the PIs from the non-primary children become Co-Is on the parent. When we sync the people in the hierarchy, we should also be setting leadUnit = false on all of their associated units.

  * 3.) change rates so that code performs a rate sync (had to change code to get his to happen, not sure how it happens via the app)
  * 4.) try to create a new budget.
  * 5.) get STE below.

* RESKC-1308: Fix IP to Award data feed. (#1723)

  * System is ignoring the parameter setting for All_Sponsor_Hierarchy_NIH_Multiple_PI = Y.
  * While it presents and allows the user to select PI/Multiple in IP and Award, and appears to add that participant, the person is not fully saved in the record.
  * Their section 'disappears' on the Contacts screen, but the validation for Credit Split persists if that feature is enabled.
  * Fix must resolve the following:
  * 1. IP should not ignore the All Sponsor PI Multiple parameter
  * 2. Award should not ignore the All Sponsor PI Multiple parameeter
  * 3. When IP fed as funding source to Award, system should not ignore PI Multiple.
  * 
  * In stage:
  * Award created and added IP *3284 as funding source which brings in 2 contacts: PI Maher and PI/Multi Majumdar.
  * Added required fields to save; added template.
  * Contacts screen: found Maher as PI, but Majumdar imports as a Key Person (SHOULD BE PI/Multiple).
  * Test 1: Actions > Submit - got validation error re: credit split not = 100.
  * Returned to Contacts: Majumdar was no longer visible on screen. Stuck - cancelled award.
  * Test 2: recreated the award with the same funding proposal.
  * On Contacts: DELETED Majumdar key person. Searched and added back as PI/Multiple. Saved,
  * Again - Majumdar info on Contact screen disappears.
  * Cannot submit award due to persistent validation error for credit split - so the person is still in the record.  * Gayathri Athreya on Thu, 5 May 2016 12:03:47 -0700 [View Commit](../../commit/40d827095a73765ae8f2cc0c0e18b1c8a41798ea)

Do not push special versions for iacuc and irb (Amendment, Renewal, FYI, Continuation).  Do not push parent proposal development documents when in a hierarchy.  Added metadata to the json payload containing system specific information.  This information can be use for logging or auditing of projects being pushed.  So far the actual primary keys for the projects being pushed is the only metadata being included.

  * As a Negotiation Administrator, I only want active values to appear in the drop-down lists when I create or edit a negotiation so that I don't incorrectly select an inactive value.
  * 
  * Steps to recreate issue:
  * 1. System Admin Portal > Negotiations > Negotiation Activity Type (or Negotiation Location)
  * 2. Click to open the Lookup window
  * 3. Click on "Both" for the Active field to locate all values (active & inactive)
  * 4. Click search
  * 5. Note any that are Inactive (Active column = "No") and if all are Active, edit one to make it Inactive
  * 6. KRAD Porgal > Central Admin > Preaward > Negotations
  * 7. When in the Negotiation Document, click show on Activities & Attachments panel.
  * 8. Click Show to open the Add Activity.
  * 9. Click on the drop down for Activity Type (or Location)
  * RESULT: Inactive value is appearing in the drop-down list for Activity Type (or Location).
  * EXPECTED RESULT: Only active values should appear in drop-down lists.  * Travis Schneeberger on Fri, 29 Apr 2016 21:43:21 -0400 [View Commit](../../commit/067b4a8a8d1f30ccddb65154200fc62ba5dc1edb)
* RESKC-1211: IRB and IACUC FYI process enhancement

  * Problem: IRB was not always easily able to keep track of all notify IRB (FYI) actions, because admin only needs to acknowledge. This does not support a process where IRB admins often need to go back and forth with PI/Dept Admin to get needed documentation.
  * Contributed Solution:
  * -Model a special routing for the FYI/ Notify IRB process to be similar to the amendment protocol process, except does not allow modification of the protocol itself other than notes and attachments.
  * -IRB can now obtain more information and even approve/disapprove action.
  * -Upon approve the attachments role into the notes and attachments history for tracking.
  * -Parameterized.
  * -IACUC is also addressed.
  * This enhancement was discussed and approved by the KCC IRB subcommittee in 05/2014. Foundation Jira is KRAFDBCK-10691. Also, was shared with the IACUC Subcommittee.

* RESKC-1279: Fix medusa for subaward. (#1690)

  * When viewing the Medusa tab from either an Award or IP when there is a linked Subaward, the incorrect Subaward Data is displayed and the "open subaward" button opens the wrong Subaward.
  * There are a few related JIRAs (774, 894, 743) but I do not see any that address the fact that the incorrect Subaward data is displayed and link is broken. This seems to only occur in Award and IP (in other modules incorrect ID is also displayed but link and info is correct).
  * This occurs in Test Drive 1604.28 and our local 1512 environment.
  * To duplicate this issue consistently. In the database, SUBAWARD_ID is actually a different value than Subaward ID in the application (Subaward ID in application = SUBAWARD_CODE in db). It appears as if Medusa tab for Award and IP display both values and the info displayed and open button are linked to the SUBAWARD_ID and not SUBAWARD_CODE in database.  * Gayathri Athreya on Mon, 25 Apr 2016 14:12:44 -0700 [View Commit](../../commit/d3d18780ecfc25c9a45a2fdd2d20be995f0b05fb)

  * Submit the protocol without the schedule
  * Then assign a reviewer via Assign Reviewers action
  * -Issue Two result: The review assignment is saved but the Review tab does not appear. See screen shot

* RESKC-904:Fixed obligated amounts datatype.

  * In the Award Budget, the user must budget to exactly match the Obligated Total in order to submit the budget.
  * Currently, the system displays the Obligated Total rounded to whole dollar values in several fields:
  * > in the Non-Personnel Budget Overview
  * > rebudget >  line item detail if cents were in original item.

  * In Res demo 1: Award 000295-00001
  * Award budget versions screen displays the actual Obligated 144,638.69
  * Non-Personnel Budget Overview displays 144,639
  * (my expenses were full dollar amounts, so I did not see the rounding in the obligated column in the line item detail, but I expect this to be consistent with MIT's report.)

  * Desired Result: NONE of the Obligated total fields in Award Budget should round: they should ALWAYS display the exact value as this is the target amount the users must reach.

  * In an example budget, the obligated amount from Version 1 in the first screenshot (MITKC 2231a) does not match the obligated amount in Version 2 in the second screen shot (MITKC 2231b)
  * Version 1  award budget non-personnel tab displays "1686.00" for obligated amount (ROUNDED)
  * Version 2 award budget non-personnel tab displays for obligated amt 1685.51. (Actual obligated amount)

  * Calculations are correct, display is wrong. There should NOT be rounding.

  * Go to Budget Notes.
  * In the Notes field, PASTE in some text from a MSWord doc with some special formatting like curly quotes, curly apostrophes, or em-dashes.

  * Select Budget version from top menu bar, select Actions > Mark Budget complete for this budget.
  * Close budget (by closing browser window if necessary).
  * Open proposal to edit. Go to Summary Submit screen. Select [Submit For Review]
  * Result: the validation error message appears.

  * DESIRED RESULTS:
  * 1. Eliminate the Error. Budget Notes are not utilized in S2S submissions where special text is a problem, so any entries should be allowed as long as they are compatible with the database. There is no need to validate this so strictly. Warn the user: "*Pasted in text may include formatting that will not appear, please use plain text or manually type in the notes. *"
  * 2. Alternative: reduce it to a warning.

* RESKC-949: Adding coi disclosure status to Prop dev personnel.
  * As a researcher or admin responsible for a project, I can see the COI disclosure status of project person to determine if the project can move forward or if project personnel need disclosures for the project to proceed.
  * General Acceptance Criteria:
  * See subtasks.
  * Configurable in monolith so it is only displayed in a module if desired by the school.
  * For each project person, display the latest status of the annual disclosure that includes that project.
  * if the project is not on annnual yet, display "Not yet disclosed"
  * if a project is not required to disclose display "Not Required"

* Copied awards with multiple award amount info errors on save

  * Awards copied that contain multiple award amount infos from a time and money document fail on initial save with the following error.
  * ```
  * org.springframework.dao.DataIntegrityViolationException: OJB operation; SQL []; Column 'AWARD_NUMBER' cannot be null; nested exception is com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException: Column 'AWARD_NUMBER' cannot be null
  * ```
  * This was because the indexOfAwardAmountInfoToDisplay would get set during versioning/sequencing due to a lazy initializer. After the versioning the amount info list is truncated leaving the indexOfAmountInfoToDisplay at a much higher number than exists. Then the KNS view of the initial page would populate the awardAmountInfo list with new, uninitialized values. Attempting to save these new items would throw the exception above.

* RESKC-1179: Fixed hierarchy org issue.

  * A user creates a proposal hierarchy with at least two proposals. The proposal is finalized and submitted for routing. User realizes that the budget entries mean that there should be "other organizations" listed. User recalls the proposal.
  * User navigates to the parent proposal and then to the organization section, other organization tab. User searches for and adds four organizations. Save and Continue and all seems fine, as soon as the user chooses another tab in the left navigation there is a STE.
  * User expects to see new organizations added, and be able to navigate normally with the ability to re-submit for review.
steps to reproduce
  * Hierarchy had been successfully created, routed, and then returned for revisions.
  * With PD Status of Revisions Requested, DLC user had gone into Parent to edit and add several "Other Organizations" in Organization and Location section at request of OSP Approver.
  * User successfully added 4 Other Organizations.
  * Then began getting Incident reports with every attempt at navigating in the PD while editing.
  * When opened with Edit on Basics > Proposal Details screen, any attempt at navigating results in an Incident report, even simply clicking Proposal Details (the same screen user is on).
  * NOTE - at parent, when user opens in View and navigates to the Organizations & Locations, the Applicant Organization and Performing Organization tabs are both blank. This is normally populated with data by default. Child proposals still have this filled with data.

* RESKC-1038: When attempting to add an Activity or modify Activity End date, user receives incorrect validation message if Activity End Date is later than Negotiation End Date.

  * Message says "Activity End Date must be the same or later than the Activity Start Date". This message is incorrect and only way to resolve is to fix Negotiation End Date or Activity End Date (not Activity Start Date). This affects "Complete" Negotiation docs.
  * Steps to Reproduce
  * 1. Open/Create and complete Negotiation doc (End Date listed).
  * 2. Add/Modify Activity with Activity End Date later than Negotiation End Date (but with Activity Start Date before Activity End Date)
  * 3. Validation will say that Activity Start date must be before Activity End Date, even though it already is.
  * 4. Extend Negotiation End Date or shorten Activity End date to fix error.
  * Expected: The system should be checking if the activity end date is >= to the activity start date and show the message "Activity End Date must be the same or later than the Activity Start Date" whenever that is not true. Activity dates should not run against the Negotiation Dates
  * It seems like the error message that is displaying is for another situation

* RESKC-1152: Added new KRMS functions for award, PD, IP and IRB

  * This contribution is a series of KRMS functions for use in a variety of modules as well as the code necessary to allow functions in IP to work properly.  That code was left out of IP and Subaward when KRMS was linked to those modules.

  * Included Functions:

  * IRB: Does the Protocol contain a specified participant type?:  This function takes a parameter that is the participant type code or label and then returns true if any members of that participant type are included in the protocol.

  * How many participants does Protocol have of Type(_)?: This function accepts a participating type code or description and then returns a number equal to the number of participants of that type listed in the protocol.  This allows the user to use a variety of comparison operands with this function such as > < or =.

  * Check Protocol has Amendment Section(_): This function checks to see if a certain section of the protocol is being modified by an amendment and then returns true if it is.  It accepts the application labels for the various amendment sections listed in the protocol amendment action panel.

  * Check Protocol has Funding Source with Sponsor Type(_): This accepts a sponsor type label or code and then returns true if a funding source of sponsor is listed with a sponsor of that type.  It does not check the sponsor on linked grants documents.

  * Check if Base Protocol has Last Approval Date: This function will return true if the base protocol associated with a given document has a "Last Approval Date" listed.

  * Check if Sponsor and Prime Sponsor are the same: This function will return true if the sponsor and prime sponsor in a document are the same.  This function is being submitted for PD, IP and Award.  This is to accommodate schools that do not want prime sponsor listed if there is not one.

  * Check if Award has a Comment Entered of Type(_): This function is setup for Award and accepts Comment Type Code.  If there is any text in that comment for the award document it will return true.  This is to accomodate schools that have KFS integration turned on and want to check for fields that are required for account setup, but not OOB Award setup before an award is finalized to minimize award correction.

  * Check if Award/IP has a special review with the specified type(_) This accepts a special review type code and will return true if the award/IP has a special review entry listed of that type.

  * Check if Property has changed since the previous award version(_) This award function accepts a Property name.  It will return true if that field has changed since the last version of the award.  This will accept any variable name that can be used by the Term Specification property system, but the variable doesn't have to be setup in advance as a property.  If there are certain values in an award that are not supposed to be changed by general staff this is a good way to catch data entry errors.

  * Check Previous Version has Property matching value(_,_): This award function accepts a property name that follows the same variable rules as the last function.  It also accepts a value.  If any previous version of the award has that value then it will return true.  At IU there are certain things the staff are not supposed to change once an award has been made active.  They have more leeway to make changes while an award is in pre-award expenditure or pending status.  This allowed us to build validations based on those fields.  We specifically didn't hard code this to those fields so it could be flexible for other schools to utilize for other purposes.

  * Check if IP has a fiscal month the same as the current fiscal month: This will return true if the fiscal month is the same as the one listed on the IP.  This basically checks to see if the IP was finalized in a previous fiscal month.  This was necessary to prevent the alteration of certain data in historic records.

* RESKC-1166: A person entered as Multi-PI on an proposal or institute proposal is not being brought forward when funded to an award. All Key Personnel listed on Proposal should populate on an initiated institute proposal, and all personnel on an institutional proposal should populate on a linked award. The person in the Multi-PI role is currently dropped from award completely. They must still appear with the same role as from institutional proposal.

            *steps to reproduce*
            Create an Ip
            Add a PI and  a Multi PI,
            Complete the other fields required to submit
            Start a new award

* RESKC-1162, Proposal Hierarchy does not delete personnel attachment from parent, Sync on non-employee personnel attachments cause an STE, In the Personnel Attachments Screen, when the User adds Personnel and their corresponding attachments, then clicks Save, the Personnel name disappears.

  * Steps to reproduce RESKC-1162:
  * 1) create a proposal.
  * 2) add two persons
  * 3) add a biosketch attachment for each person (two in total)
  * 4) save
  * 5) add budget
  * 6) return to proposal
  * 7) create sub budget hierarchy
  * 8) close child, open parent, confirm the two biosketch attachments exist on the parent
  * 9) close parent, open child
  * 10) delete one biosketch attachment
  * 11) save
  * 12) sync to parent
  * 13) close child, open parent
  * you will notice the parent still has two biosketch attachments even though it should only have one attachment.

  * Steps to reproduce 
  * 1) add non employee Key Person to a child in a hierarchy, save
  * 2) sync to parent
  * 3) close child
  * 4) open parent
  * 5) confirm the Key Person is listed at the parent
  * 6) close parent
  * 7) open child
  * 8) add a biosketch attachments for this KP at the child, save
  * 9) either:  sync to parent
  * STE 1 results.
  * OR close child. open parent. Sync All from parent.
  * STE 2 Results
  * you will notice both attachments are still on the parent.

  * Steps to reproduce 
  * To reproduce:
  * Create a proposal, or find one that is In Progress to edit.
  * if new proposal, enter the required fields to save.
  * Navigate to Key Personnel screen.
  * if new proposal, add personnel, and search for an Employee and add them as PI
  * Click Add Personnel> click 'Non Employee' to search the Address Book
  * locate and add the address book person as a co-investigator
  * Navigate to Attachments,
  * Select Personnel tab> Click Add
  * Choose the Address book Person from dropdown list
  * Add File and Description
  * At this point the name will be visible in the list of Personnel (FIG 1)
  * Click Save and the names disappear. (FIG 2)

  * Other issues also fixed:

  * 1) when a duplicate personnel attachment exists across child proposals, syncing from the parent will cause the duplicates to show up on the parent. Syncing from a child will filter out the duplicates. This is now corrected.
  * 2) non employee personnel attachments do not show the proposal person name
  * 3) non employee personnel attachments do not allow edits on the parent when duplicates exist on children. This differs from how employee personnel attachments work when duplicates exist on children.
  * 4) non employee personnel attachments can be added and maintained at the parent even when duplicates do not exist
  * 5) when a duplicate personnel attachment exists across child proposals, the child attachments should not be editable. This is correct exception the description textarea is still editable

User cannot type any info in the Object Code Name field. Instead, the system opens up the menu where user can scroll alphabetically to select the Object Code Name they want: Desired result - User should be able to start typing name or number in Object Code Name field when adding a line item. 2. After adding a line item, the user only see the Object Code Name, and does not see the Object Code Number. Desired result - After entering a line item, user should see both the Object Code Number and Name in the Object Code Name field.

  * Currently, when an administrator attempts to edit an existing Rate, a random rate maintenance document is opened, not the one selected.
  * Please modify the Edit & Copy features for Institute Rates and Institute LA Rates maintenance documents so that they present the selected item (missing primary key).
  * To duplicate:
  * From the System Admin Portal > Maintenance Screen > Shared >
  * -Institute Rate > search
  * -Institute LA Rate > search
  * or Miscellaneous > Unit Hierarchy > [rates] or [LA rates] button(s)
  * Perform a rate search using one of the above navigation paths.
  * In the result set: Select either Edit or Copy of a particular rate.
  * Result: The selected rate type will NOT open (unless it is the first action of the day after a rebuild).
  * Instead, either a random rate is opened, or often, the MTDC rate (Activity, Rate Class and Rate Type codes all equal 1) But for a random FY period.

* RESKC-1145: Added fringe totals to exclusion list when Overhead not applied.
  * In KC budget, in the line item details (both in Non-Personnel Costs and SPE screens) or personnel group Details & Rates, if you uncheck the "Apply Rate" box for MTDC, the IDC in the budget is correctly adjusted to exclude the unchecked amounts.
  * However, when you print the budget forms, the calculated fringe amount is not listed in the Page 2: Calculation Methodology: exclusions. When Personnel expenses use the 'unapply rate' option, the _salary _is listed as excluded, but associated fringes are not there.
  * The correct BASE does appear in the next section (F&A Cost Rates and Base), and is correct Page 1.
  * But a user should be able to manually calculate the Base by subtracting the Total exclusions from the F&A Base from the Total Direct Costs. We cannot get to this value the way the report prints today.
  * Steps to reproduce:
  * Create a budget for a research proposal
  * Add a Personnel, and assign them to the period.
  * Once added, click Details & Rates to open that window. Click on the Rates tab and uncheck the "Apply" box for MTDC. Save.
  * Save ( you can autogenerate periods or just review P1)
  * Toolbar > Budget Versions > Print > #4 Budget Summary Report > Create PDF.
  * ON p2 in the methodology - review the total exclusions to F&A.
  * Notice: the salary row appears in the list exclusions, but the calculated fringe does not.
  * Subtract that Total Exclusions value from the Total Direct Costs on P1.
  * Review the F&A Base in the next section on the form: it does not match your calculated amount.

##coeus-1601.75
* RESKC-671: Adding ability to change proposal person role after addition. Cannot reproduce the STE mentioned so added test to verify.
  * Duplicated in res-test1.
  * Created initiating child proposal #6379 with PI user rhanlon
  * Created parent #6380. Using Summary/submit screen, confirmed rhanlon was PI in both parent and child.
  * Key Persons> deleted rhanlon as PI, searched and added Eagle as PI.
  * Synced to parent.
  * On Summary/Submit screen: Eagle was listed as Co-i on Parent proposal, and PI on child.
  * Using the Toolbar> Hierarchy> I tried to unlink the proposal from the parent. I got an STE. see comments.
  * In a Proposal Hierarchy, the PI on the Child proposal that creates the Parent proposal, becomes the lead PI on the Parent proposal. However, if after creating the Parent proposal, the PI changes and the user goes to the Child Proposal and changes the PI there first and syncs the change to the Parent proposal. The 'old' PI is removed (or role is modified - depending on the change made) from the Parent proposal BUT the new PI that was designated, synced as a Co-Investigator to the Parent proposal. This resulted in the Parent not having a PI - no matter what the user did (everyone appeared as a Co-Investigator or Key Person). We tried deleting and adding people back in and syncing and nothing work.
  * This happened in Production last week - DBA had to change the Role assignment for the PI in the Database.
  * Desired Behavior: If there is a PI change on the Child proposal that created the Parent proposal, the system should sync that change to the Parent proposal - assigning the PI role and NOT as Co-Investigator on the Parent proposal.
  * WORK AROUND: Create a new parent from the corrected lead child proposal.
  * Steps to Reproduce:
  * 1.    Create a Proposal (with minimum info to save)
  * 2.    Add a PI in the Key Personnel section
  * 3.    Create/add Budget (no need to add any costs - budget just needs to be initiated to create/link hierarchy)
  * 4.    In the Budget, click the Return to proposal button
  * 5.    In the Proposal, click the Hierarchy link in the toolbar. In the Hierarchy window select:
  * a.    Hierarchy Budget Type: Sub Budget
  * b.    Click the Create Hierarchy button
  * c.    Note the Parent Proposal number generated
  * d.    Close out of your proposal
  * 6.    Go to the Parent Proposal and navigate to the Key Personnel section. You should see the Person you designed as the PI in your Child proposal, appear as the PI in your Parent proposal
  * 7.    Close out of the Parent proposal
  * 8.    Navigate back to your Child Proposal and go to the Key Personnel Section
  * 9.    In the Key Personnel Section, delete the current PI
  * 10.   Add a different person as the new PI and save
  * 11.   Click the Hierarchy (C) link in the toolbar. In the Hierarchy window:
  * a.    Click the Sync Hierarchy button. (You should get a Synchronization successful message)
  * 12.   Navigate to the Parent Proposal -> Key Personnel section
  * 13.   You will see that the old PI that you deleted from the Child proposal, was removed from the Parent proposal.
  * 14.   BUT the new Person you added to the child proposal as the new PI, synced to the Parent as a Co-Investigator. - see Parent Proposal Number 27528 in KC QA
  * (There is no way from this point on, to get someone to appear as the PI on that Parent Proposal. Other individuals from the any additional child proposals will automatically sync as Co-Investigators or Key Persons.)
  * The only work-around for this is to unlink and create a new Proposal Hierarchy with the correct PI or have the role assignment changed by DB Admin.
  * MITKC-2033
  * ISSUE #2
  * STE upon trying to unlink the child proposal after changing the PI from Hanlon to Eagle, now Eagle as Co-I in parent and PI in only child:
  * when-present<#else>when-missing. (These only cover the last step of the expression; to cover the whole expression, use parenthessis: (myOptionVar.foo)!myDefault, (myOptionVar.foo)?? The failing instruction (FTL stack trace): ---------- ==> $

  * But the 12 month appointments vary; anniversary rate 'caught up' and correct for the period, but the regular inflation salary is at what should have been p2.
  * P4: inconsistent rate amount applied: no amounts match the expected salary
  * P's5, 6 & 7: SOME salaries match the projected amount; But the 9 and 10 month Anniversary rates salaries display what was expected for the prior period.

* RESKC-1096: PD: STE when I try to generate GG Form Preview

  * Steps to Reproduce:
  * 1. Create a proposal with min. info to save
  * 2. In the S2S Opportunity search connect to a GG opportunity (e.g. PA-C-R01)
  * 3. While in the Opportunity search window, go to the Forms tab and check the Select checkbox for PerformanceSite_2_0 form (the proposal doesn't have much info so this is the only form that will generate at this time) and click the [Create PDF] button. The form preview should generate fine.
*4. While remaining in the Opportunity Search section, click on the Print link located in the Proposal toolbar. In the Print window > Grants.gov section, the checkbox for the PerformanceSite_2_0 form should be already selected, click the [Create PDF] button. get STE.

* RESKC-1097: In Proposal Dev, Proposal Hierarchy Parent Budget cost share lines are being duplicated in Institutional Commitments.

  * In Proposal Dev, Proposal Hierarchy Parent Budget cost share lines are being duplicated in Institutional Commitments > Cost Sharing when the Hierarchy > Sync All action is taken at the parent budget level.

  * Each time the sync is performed, additional lines are pulled into the distribution screen, rather than the existing ones being updated (or all deleted then written anew from the child budgets upon sync).

  * This does NOT happen when the Budget > Hierarchy > Sync to parent action is taken from an individual child. However, there are scenarios when it is not feasible to sync individually from each child rather than from the parent, particularly when children are from different units with different aggregators.

*Desired result:*
  * Syncing All from Hierarchy Parent Budget should not add new rows to those already existing at the parent budget Commitments - Cost Sharing.
  * Sync All from Parent Budget should remove all existing rows replace with the current rows from each child proposal budget with cost sharing commitments entered.

  * Steps to reproduce:

  * Create a 2 year proposal with basic information
  * Key person: PI
  * Create a Budget: add non-personnel line item at $1000, in Details, add same $1000 amount in the Cost Sharing field. Unclick the "Apply Inflation" for the line item.
  * Autogenerate periods.
  * On Commitments > Cost Sharing, enter source account as "1234567" in a row for each year for the $1000 direct costs; leave unit number blank and percentage at 0% (MIT does not usually use).
  * Add an additional row for each period for the F&A amount ($5,600 at in MIT KC WKLy): enter source account as 1402600 (all MIT uses this account for Cost Sharing F&A); leave unit number blank and percentage at 0%
  * Complete the budget.
  * Return to the proposal >
  * Toolbar > Hierarchy > create a parent with this proposal as sub-budget. Make note of the parent proposal number.
  * Toolbar > Copy > copy this proposal including the budget.

  * In the new proposal > toolbar > budget versions >Open the budget.
  * In the cost sharing distribution, change the source account for the direct costs lines for each year to "7654321".
  * Save and mark the budget as for submission and complete. (it is identical to first proposal, except for the Cost sharing direct cost source code).
  * Make a note of this child #2 proposal number.
  * Save and close proposal.

  * Open the Parent proposal .
  * Proposal Details > Toolbar > Hierarchy >  select sub-budget, enter second child proposal number and click Link a child to this Parent> Link a child to this Parent.
  * Open Budget.
  * Note Cost Sharing total by year in Periods and Totals.
  * Go to Commitments > Cost Sharing > Summary. Ensure same as the P&T amounts.
  * Note number of lines in distribution.
  * Still in budget -  Toolbar > Hierarchy >  Sync All.

  * Return to Commitments > Cost Sharing -- note that number of lines has increased, but Summary total has remained the same as have P&T total cost sharing.

  * Try to mark Budget Complete -- error regarding need to allocate all cost sharing funds will be received.

  * Turn on Validations - same error will be received.

  * Try Sync All again - it does not fix the problem but brings in yet more duplicate rows.

* RESKC-1095:PD Budget: new validation to enforce Proposal and Budget Start/End dates breaks several business processes

  * The current fix does not allow the flexibility needed for different types of proposal submissions to comply with sponsor requested preparation (e.g. supplement proposals where the entire project period is to be entered in the proposal but the budget is to include on the start and end date covering the supplemental funds spending), or for syncing child proposal budget date changes to a hierarchy.

  * The validation needs to be changed from requiring budget start and end dates to match the proposal start and end dates to instead enforcing that the budget start date falls after the proposal start date and the budget end date falls before the proposal period end date.
  * The budget start and end dates must both fall within the project period, rather than match exactly.

*  RESKC-1058: The subrecipient DUNS number needs to display on screen near the other FAIN information related to Uniform Guidance to ease reporting.

  * The field for subrecpient's display of name was not large enough to accomodate the DUNS as well. Therefore, we should move that field to the bottom of the section so that the area can expand to show the DUNS and subrecipient name in one location. This would seperate the Subrecipient from the Sub Investigator however, so we also require that the sub Investigator move to be directly above the new subrecipient display placement. To do that, we will move the execution date to the former placement of the subrecipient.

* PD - COI Disclosure Status button and Window should display if logic requires certification

  * This is a business process requirement.
  * The COI Disclosure status button and window should display if any and all logic triggers the requirement for any proposal person to certify (sponsor hierarchy, PCK flag, proposal types, etc).
  * The button should display when personnel are added to the proposal.
  * When opened the window should remain unpopulated unless and until a proposal person answers with a Yes to one of the COI screening questions in proposal certifications maintained in PROP_PERSON_COI_CERTIFY_QID.

  * Currently the COI Disclosure status button will not display until a person has answered a yes to one of the COI screening questions in proposal certifications. Showing no COI Disclosure Status button is confusing as could mean no requirement for certification by logic or by a persons answers. The window should display if logic requires certification by any proposal persons.

* PD - Inactive COI Notification based on answers still generating

  * Confirmed the PD notification 10407 "Notification based on answers to the COI screening questions" was not Active in MITQA.
  * Created PD 30523 added personnel. Backdoor logged in as co-Investigator user mgb who answered Yes to all three COI screening questions. We got the on screen prompt modal instructing user to disclose in Coeus lite. And the attached email notification was generated to mgb stating user must complete a full disclosure before proposal can be routed.

  * Since this notification is not active it should not generate.

* IP & Award: System is allowing users to edit prior document versions when a later version of the document exists.

  * The system is allowing users to edit prior Institutional and Award document Versions but it does not pull in the data from the latest finalized version.

  * For example, in the Institutional Proposal module, if I edit an IP record - the correct Version number gets assigned regardless of what version I click the [edit] button in. However, I noticed that the information in the newly created version pulls in from the IP version I have clicked the [edit] button in and NOT from the latest finalized IP version that exists. (SAME IS HAPPENING IN THE AWARD).

  * For example, let's assume I have an IP that has a latest finalized Version 3 with title 'Kat - Version 3'. I edit that version to create Version 4 with title 'Kat - Version 4' and finalize that. I then go back to Version 3 and I edit that version, KC will assign the correct Version number (Version 5), however, the title that will pull in will be 'Kat - Version 3' and not 'Kat - Version 4'.

  * If a user jots down a doc number – they won’t look to see if a later version exists so we will run into wrong data being pulled into the IPs and Awards. To avoid this problem, the system should only allow users to EDIT the LATEST FINALIZED VERSION. Prior document versions should NOT have an [edit] button.

  * For PD Hierarchy, when the Parent proposal is created from a proposal in

  * rates is linked to the Parent Proposal, the line for "Allocated Lab
  * Expense" that should appear under Other Direct Costs is not included in

  * 1 Budget Costshare Summary Report
  * 2 Budget Cumulative Report
  * 4 Budget Summary Report
  * 7 Industrial Budget Report
  * Also, Lab Allocation is not being included in the Calculation
  * Methodology section on the following Budget Print Reports: (For the

  * 2 Budget Cumulative Report
  * 4 Budget Summary Report
  * 7 Industrial Budget Report

  * fixes are linked below.
  * This is not a problem on the individual child LA-unit proposals in the
  * hierarchy when printed, only at the parent level.
  * Steps to reproduce in res-demo1:
  * A.	Create Child Proposal 1 and Parent Proposal:
  * In the Create Proposal screen enter/select:
  * Proposal Type: New
  * Lead Unit: IN-PED – Pediatrics (this is a Unit that does not have Lab
  * Allocation rates)
  * Activity Type: Research
  * Project Dates: 11/01/2016 – 10/31/2017
  * Project Title: <any>
  * Sponsor: NIH
  * Click the [Save and Continue] button
  * In the Key Personnel > Personnel section, add a PI to the Proposal
  * In the Budget section:
  * Add a Budget Version
  * In the Budget:
  * o	Personnel Costs > Project Personnel section, add Base Salary for the
  * PI
  * o	Personnel Costs > Assign Personnel to Periods section, click the
  * [Assign Personnel …] button and complete as follows:
  * 	Person: <PI>
  * 	Object Code: Faculty Salaries Tenured – On
  * 	Effort %: 10
  * 	Charged %: 10
  * 	Click [Assign to Period 1] 
  * 	Click the Details & Rate link for the Faculty Salaries Tenured – On
  * Object Code and review Rate Tab (you should see amounts for Employee
  * Benefits – Research Rate, and MTDC)
  * o	Save your budget and click the [Return to proposal] button
  * Back in the Proposal, click the Hierarchy link located in the Toolbar.
  * In the Hierarchy window:
  * Hierarchy Budget Type: Sub-Budget
  * Click the [Create Hierarchy] button. The Parent proposal will be created
  * – note the parent proposal number
  * Close out of the Proposal
  * B.	Create Child Proposal 2 and Link it to Parent Proposal created in A:
  * In the Create Proposal screen enter/select:
  * Proposal Type: New
  * Lead Unit: IN-CARD – Cardiology (this is a Unit that has Lab Allocation
  * rates)
  * Activity Type: Research
  * Project Dates: 11/01/2016 – 10/31/2017
  * Project Title: <any>
  * Sponsor: NIH

  * PI
  * o	Personnel Costs > Assign Personnel to Periods section, click the
  * [Assign Personnel …] button and complete as follows:
  * 	Person: <PI>
  * 	Object Code: Summer Faculty – On

  * 	Click [Assign to Period 1] 
  * 	Click the Details & Rate link for the Faculty Salaries Tenured – On
  * Object Code and review Rate Tab (you should see amounts for Employee
  * Benefits – Research Rate, EB on LA, LA-M&S, LA-Salaries, LA-Utilities,
  * Vaca on LA, and MTDC)
  * 	Click the Budget Versions link and select Print from the Actions:
  * •	Select the checkbox for the Budget Summary Report and click the
  * [Print] button. The PDF will generated. Note the following: 
  * o	‘Allocated Lab Expense’ line under Other Direct Cost
  * o	Calculation Methodology 
  * o	Save your budget and click the [Return to proposal] button
  * Back in the Proposal, click the Hierarchy link located in the Toolbar.
  * In the Hierarchy window:
  * Link Proposal: <enter Parent Proposal Number created in A>
  * Hierarchy Budget Type: Sub-Budget
  * Click the [Link this Child to a Parent] button.
  * Close out of the Child 2 Proposal
  * C.	Open the Parent Proposal and navigate to the Budget:
  * In the Personnel Costs > Assign Personnel to Periods section, click the
  * Details & Rate link for the Faculty Salaries Tenured – On Object Code
  * (this is from Child 1 Budget). In the Rates tab, you will notice that

  * When viewing personnel item Details & Rates, when the Default or Custom Group includes entries from multiple children, the Details & Rates only reflects the amounts from the child budget that created the parent. The info from the other personnel items are not reflected. (This seems to be happening in all hierarchy proposals - not just the ones with LA and non-LA units)
  * (Only if each child budget has separate Custom Group(s) they used for entering each of their shared person cost element types, then it shows correctly in the details & rates. Or, if there is a Default or Custom group (g/l or cost element) that contains only salaries from one child, and there are no personnel from the other children in that cost element/category, then it displays correctly.)  * Gayathri Athreya on Tue, 29 Nov 2016 14:05:59 -0700 [View Commit](../../commit/8031d630c496f35bd36bfcabfb427578284d9c29)

* RESKC-1586: Integration Test and fix. (#2018)

  * In a Proposal Hierarchy, If a non-lead child proposal has a PI which is different from the Parent PI, and that person has only one unit associated, then after linking to the hierarchy, syncing all from the parent and then running the data validations
  * Bug: The Data Validation is deleting that person's unit.
  * Turn Validation off and the unit is still not appearing. The unit is not deleted from the child proposal.
  * Workaround - user can manually re-add the unit at the parent and then the unit stays associated even after data validation is turned on.
  * Requirement
  * Hierarchy Proposal Investigator Units	The system shall display all of the units listed in any of the child proposals as associated with the Co-Investigators. - the parent proposal should update (even with sync) to show all co-I units from all child proposals
  * The proposal hierarchy summary should show the parent as updating with additional units from personnel on child proposals.
  * Technical Details:
  * ProposalDevelopmentKeyPersonsRule.processSaveKeyPersonBusinessRules() removes the lead unit from non-PIs. The validation shouldn't be causing a side-effect, but it is. What it's checking for is whether or not the person is listed as a PI. If they are not the PI, then it checks to see if any of the unit are listed as the lead unit and removes them. This covers the case when a PI is down-graded to a Co-I and should follow the new PI. However, this breaks on hierarchy sync because the PIs from the non-primary children become Co-Is on the parent. When we sync the people in the hierarchy, we should also be setting leadUnit = false on all of their associated units.

* RESKC-673: fix footer getting stuck in middle of page

  * Losing access to some of the left-hand navigation buttons, including Delivery Info, Budget, Access, Summary/Submit, etc. when page footer floats and does not allow user to scroll past.
  * I believe it IS happening consistently when both left nav sections that have sub sections are open; so when both Basics and Key Personnel are open and showing sub menu options.
  * Only workaround we have identified is to keep clicking nav buttons toward the top of the list which refreshes the screen until the issue resolves.

* RESKC-1308: Fix IP to Award data feed. (#1723)

  * System is ignoring the parameter setting for All_Sponsor_Hierarchy_NIH_Multiple_PI = Y.
  * While it presents and allows the user to select PI/Multiple in IP and Award, and appears to add that participant, the person is not fully saved in the record.
  * Their section 'disappears' on the Contacts screen, but the validation for Credit Split persists if that feature is enabled.
  * Fix must resolve the following:
  * 1. IP should not ignore the All Sponsor PI Multiple parameter
  * 2. Award should not ignore the All Sponsor PI Multiple parameeter
  * 3. When IP fed as funding source to Award, system should not ignore PI Multiple.
  * 
  * In stage:
  * Award created and added IP *3284 as funding source which brings in 2 contacts: PI Maher and PI/Multi Majumdar.
  * Added required fields to save; added template.
  * Contacts screen: found Maher as PI, but Majumdar imports as a Key Person (SHOULD BE PI/Multiple).
  * Test 1: Actions > Submit - got validation error re: credit split not = 100.
  * Returned to Contacts: Majumdar was no longer visible on screen. Stuck - cancelled award.
  * Test 2: recreated the award with the same funding proposal.
  * On Contacts: DELETED Majumdar key person. Searched and added back as PI/Multiple. Saved,
  * Again - Majumdar info on Contact screen disappears.
  * Cannot submit award due to persistent validation error for credit split - so the person is still in the record.  * Gayathri Athreya on Thu, 5 May 2016 12:03:47 -0700 [View Commit](../../commit/40d827095a73765ae8f2cc0c0e18b1c8a41798ea)

  * As a Negotiation Administrator, I only want active values to appear in the drop-down lists when I create or edit a negotiation so that I don't incorrectly select an inactive value.
  * 
  * Steps to recreate issue:
  * 1. System Admin Portal > Negotiations > Negotiation Activity Type (or Negotiation Location)
  * 2. Click to open the Lookup window
  * 3. Click on "Both" for the Active field to locate all values (active & inactive)
  * 4. Click search
  * 5. Note any that are Inactive (Active column = "No") and if all are Active, edit one to make it Inactive
  * 6. KRAD Porgal > Central Admin > Preaward > Negotations
  * 7. When in the Negotiation Document, click show on Activities & Attachments panel.
  * 8. Click Show to open the Add Activity.
  * 9. Click on the drop down for Activity Type (or Location)
  * RESULT: Inactive value is appearing in the drop-down list for Activity Type (or Location).
  * EXPECTED RESULT: Only active values should appear in drop-down lists.  * Travis Schneeberger on Fri, 29 Apr 2016 21:43:21 -0400 [View Commit](../../commit/067b4a8a8d1f30ccddb65154200fc62ba5dc1edb)
* RESKC-1211: IRB and IACUC FYI process enhancement

  * Problem: IRB was not always easily able to keep track of all notify IRB (FYI) actions, because admin only needs to acknowledge. This does not support a process where IRB admins often need to go back and forth with PI/Dept Admin to get needed documentation.
  * Contributed Solution:
  * -Model a special routing for the FYI/ Notify IRB process to be similar to the amendment protocol process, except does not allow modification of the protocol itself other than notes and attachments.
  * -IRB can now obtain more information and even approve/disapprove action.
  * -Upon approve the attachments role into the notes and attachments history for tracking.
  * -Parameterized.
  * -IACUC is also addressed.
  * This enhancement was discussed and approved by the KCC IRB subcommittee in 05/2014. Foundation Jira is KRAFDBCK-10691. Also, was shared with the IACUC Subcommittee.

  * When viewing the Medusa tab from either an Award or IP when there is a linked Subaward, the incorrect Subaward Data is displayed and the "open subaward" button opens the wrong Subaward.
  * There are a few related JIRAs (774, 894, 743) but I do not see any that address the fact that the incorrect Subaward data is displayed and link is broken. This seems to only occur in Award and IP (in other modules incorrect ID is also displayed but link and info is correct).
  * This occurs in Test Drive 1604.28 and our local 1512 environment.
  * To duplicate this issue consistently. In the database, SUBAWARD_ID is actually a different value than Subaward ID in the application (Subaward ID in application = SUBAWARD_CODE in db). It appears as if Medusa tab for Award and IP display both values and the info displayed and open button are linked to the SUBAWARD_ID and not SUBAWARD_CODE in database.  * Gayathri Athreya on Mon, 25 Apr 2016 14:12:44 -0700 [View Commit](../../commit/d3d18780ecfc25c9a45a2fdd2d20be995f0b05fb)

  * Submit the protocol without the schedule
  * Then assign a reviewer via Assign Reviewers action
  * -Issue Two result: The review assignment is saved but the Review tab does not appear. See screen shot

* RESKC-904:Fixed obligated amounts datatype.

  * In the Award Budget, the user must budget to exactly match the Obligated Total in order to submit the budget.
  * Currently, the system displays the Obligated Total rounded to whole dollar values in several fields:
  * > in the Non-Personnel Budget Overview
  * > rebudget >  line item detail if cents were in original item.

  * In Res demo 1: Award 000295-00001
  * Award budget versions screen displays the actual Obligated 144,638.69
  * Non-Personnel Budget Overview displays 144,639
  * (my expenses were full dollar amounts, so I did not see the rounding in the obligated column in the line item detail, but I expect this to be consistent with MIT's report.)

  * Desired Result: NONE of the Obligated total fields in Award Budget should round: they should ALWAYS display the exact value as this is the target amount the users must reach.

  * In an example budget, the obligated amount from Version 1 in the first screenshot (MITKC 2231a) does not match the obligated amount in Version 2 in the second screen shot (MITKC 2231b)
  * Version 1  award budget non-personnel tab displays "1686.00" for obligated amount (ROUNDED)
  * Version 2 award budget non-personnel tab displays for obligated amt 1685.51. (Actual obligated amount)

  * Calculations are correct, display is wrong. There should NOT be rounding.

  * Go to Budget Notes.
  * In the Notes field, PASTE in some text from a MSWord doc with some special formatting like curly quotes, curly apostrophes, or em-dashes.

  * Select Budget version from top menu bar, select Actions > Mark Budget complete for this budget.
  * Close budget (by closing browser window if necessary).
  * Open proposal to edit. Go to Summary Submit screen. Select [Submit For Review]
  * Result: the validation error message appears.

  * DESIRED RESULTS:
  * 1. Eliminate the Error. Budget Notes are not utilized in S2S submissions where special text is a problem, so any entries should be allowed as long as they are compatible with the database. There is no need to validate this so strictly. Warn the user: "*Pasted in text may include formatting that will not appear, please use plain text or manually type in the notes. *"
  * 2. Alternative: reduce it to a warning.

* Copied awards with multiple award amount info errors on save

  * Awards copied that contain multiple award amount infos from a time and money document fail on initial save with the following error.
  * ```
  * org.springframework.dao.DataIntegrityViolationException: OJB operation; SQL []; Column 'AWARD_NUMBER' cannot be null; nested exception is com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException: Column 'AWARD_NUMBER' cannot be null
  * ```
  * This was because the indexOfAwardAmountInfoToDisplay would get set during versioning/sequencing due to a lazy initializer. After the versioning the amount info list is truncated leaving the indexOfAmountInfoToDisplay at a much higher number than exists. Then the KNS view of the initial page would populate the awardAmountInfo list with new, uninitialized values. Attempting to save these new items would throw the exception above.

* RESKC-1179: Fixed hierarchy org issue.

  * A user creates a proposal hierarchy with at least two proposals. The proposal is finalized and submitted for routing. User realizes that the budget entries mean that there should be "other organizations" listed. User recalls the proposal.
  * User navigates to the parent proposal and then to the organization section, other organization tab. User searches for and adds four organizations. Save and Continue and all seems fine, as soon as the user chooses another tab in the left navigation there is a STE.
  * User expects to see new organizations added, and be able to navigate normally with the ability to re-submit for review.
steps to reproduce
  * Hierarchy had been successfully created, routed, and then returned for revisions.
  * With PD Status of Revisions Requested, DLC user had gone into Parent to edit and add several "Other Organizations" in Organization and Location section at request of OSP Approver.
  * User successfully added 4 Other Organizations.
  * Then began getting Incident reports with every attempt at navigating in the PD while editing.
  * When opened with Edit on Basics > Proposal Details screen, any attempt at navigating results in an Incident report, even simply clicking Proposal Details (the same screen user is on).
  * NOTE - at parent, when user opens in View and navigates to the Organizations & Locations, the Applicant Organization and Performing Organization tabs are both blank. This is normally populated with data by default. Child proposals still have this filled with data.

* RESKC-1038: When attempting to add an Activity or modify Activity End date, user receives incorrect validation message if Activity End Date is later than Negotiation End Date.

  * Message says "Activity End Date must be the same or later than the Activity Start Date". This message is incorrect and only way to resolve is to fix Negotiation End Date or Activity End Date (not Activity Start Date). This affects "Complete" Negotiation docs.
  * Steps to Reproduce
  * 1. Open/Create and complete Negotiation doc (End Date listed).
  * 2. Add/Modify Activity with Activity End Date later than Negotiation End Date (but with Activity Start Date before Activity End Date)
  * 3. Validation will say that Activity Start date must be before Activity End Date, even though it already is.
  * 4. Extend Negotiation End Date or shorten Activity End date to fix error.
  * Expected: The system should be checking if the activity end date is >= to the activity start date and show the message "Activity End Date must be the same or later than the Activity Start Date" whenever that is not true. Activity dates should not run against the Negotiation Dates
  * It seems like the error message that is displaying is for another situation

* RESKC-1152: Added new KRMS functions for award, PD, IP and IRB

  * This contribution is a series of KRMS functions for use in a variety of modules as well as the code necessary to allow functions in IP to work properly.  That code was left out of IP and Subaward when KRMS was linked to those modules.

  * Included Functions:

  * IRB: Does the Protocol contain a specified participant type?:  This function takes a parameter that is the participant type code or label and then returns true if any members of that participant type are included in the protocol.

  * How many participants does Protocol have of Type(_)?: This function accepts a participating type code or description and then returns a number equal to the number of participants of that type listed in the protocol.  This allows the user to use a variety of comparison operands with this function such as > < or =.

  * Check Protocol has Amendment Section(_): This function checks to see if a certain section of the protocol is being modified by an amendment and then returns true if it is.  It accepts the application labels for the various amendment sections listed in the protocol amendment action panel.

  * Check Protocol has Funding Source with Sponsor Type(_): This accepts a sponsor type label or code and then returns true if a funding source of sponsor is listed with a sponsor of that type.  It does not check the sponsor on linked grants documents.

  * Check if Base Protocol has Last Approval Date: This function will return true if the base protocol associated with a given document has a "Last Approval Date" listed.

  * Check if Sponsor and Prime Sponsor are the same: This function will return true if the sponsor and prime sponsor in a document are the same.  This function is being submitted for PD, IP and Award.  This is to accommodate schools that do not want prime sponsor listed if there is not one.

  * Check if Award has a Comment Entered of Type(_): This function is setup for Award and accepts Comment Type Code.  If there is any text in that comment for the award document it will return true.  This is to accomodate schools that have KFS integration turned on and want to check for fields that are required for account setup, but not OOB Award setup before an award is finalized to minimize award correction.

  * Check if Award/IP has a special review with the specified type(_) This accepts a special review type code and will return true if the award/IP has a special review entry listed of that type.

  * Check if Property has changed since the previous award version(_) This award function accepts a Property name.  It will return true if that field has changed since the last version of the award.  This will accept any variable name that can be used by the Term Specification property system, but the variable doesn't have to be setup in advance as a property.  If there are certain values in an award that are not supposed to be changed by general staff this is a good way to catch data entry errors.

  * Check Previous Version has Property matching value(_,_): This award function accepts a property name that follows the same variable rules as the last function.  It also accepts a value.  If any previous version of the award has that value then it will return true.  At IU there are certain things the staff are not supposed to change once an award has been made active.  They have more leeway to make changes while an award is in pre-award expenditure or pending status.  This allowed us to build validations based on those fields.  We specifically didn't hard code this to those fields so it could be flexible for other schools to utilize for other purposes.

  * Check if IP has a fiscal month the same as the current fiscal month: This will return true if the fiscal month is the same as the one listed on the IP.  This basically checks to see if the IP was finalized in a previous fiscal month.  This was necessary to prevent the alteration of certain data in historic records.

All Key Personnel listed on Proposal should populate on an initiated institute proposal, and all personnel on an institutional proposal should populate on a linked award. The person in the Multi-PI role is currently dropped from award completely. They must still appear with the same role as from institutional proposal.

            *steps to reproduce*

  * 9) either:  sync to parent
  * STE 1 results.
  * OR close child. open parent. Sync All from parent.
  * STE 2 Results
  * you will notice both attachments are still on the parent.

  * Steps to reproduce 
  * To reproduce:
  * Create a proposal, or find one that is In Progress to edit.
  * if new proposal, enter the required fields to save.
  * Navigate to Key Personnel screen.
  * if new proposal, add personnel, and search for an Employee and add them as PI
  * Click Add Personnel> click 'Non Employee' to search the Address Book
  * locate and add the address book person as a co-investigator
  * Navigate to Attachments,
  * Select Personnel tab> Click Add
  * Choose the Address book Person from dropdown list
  * Add File and Description
  * At this point the name will be visible in the list of Personnel (FIG 1)
  * Click Save and the names disappear. (FIG 2)

  * Other issues also fixed:

  * 1) when a duplicate personnel attachment exists across child proposals, syncing from the parent will cause the duplicates to show up on the parent. Syncing from a child will filter out the duplicates. This is now corrected.
  * 2) non employee personnel attachments do not show the proposal person name
  * 3) non employee personnel attachments do not allow edits on the parent when duplicates exist on children. This differs from how employee personnel attachments work when duplicates exist on children.
  * 4) non employee personnel attachments can be added and maintained at the parent even when duplicates do not exist
  * 5) when a duplicate personnel attachment exists across child proposals, the child attachments should not be editable. This is correct exception the description textarea is still editable

* RESKC-1145: Added fringe totals to exclusion list when Overhead not applied.
  * In KC budget, in the line item details (both in Non-Personnel Costs and SPE screens) or personnel group Details & Rates, if you uncheck the "Apply Rate" box for MTDC, the IDC in the budget is correctly adjusted to exclude the unchecked amounts.
  * However, when you print the budget forms, the calculated fringe amount is not listed in the Page 2: Calculation Methodology: exclusions. When Personnel expenses use the 'unapply rate' option, the _salary _is listed as excluded, but associated fringes are not there.
  * The correct BASE does appear in the next section (F&A Cost Rates and Base), and is correct Page 1.
  * But a user should be able to manually calculate the Base by subtracting the Total exclusions from the F&A Base from the Total Direct Costs. We cannot get to this value the way the report prints today.
  * Steps to reproduce:
  * Create a budget for a research proposal
  * Add a Personnel, and assign them to the period.
  * Once added, click Details & Rates to open that window. Click on the Rates tab and uncheck the "Apply" box for MTDC. Save.
  * Save ( you can autogenerate periods or just review P1)
  * Toolbar > Budget Versions > Print > #4 Budget Summary Report > Create PDF.
  * ON p2 in the methodology - review the total exclusions to F&A.
  * Notice: the salary row appears in the list exclusions, but the calculated fringe does not.
  * Subtract that Total Exclusions value from the Total Direct Costs on P1.
  * Review the F&A Base in the next section on the form: it does not match your calculated amount.

* RESKC-701: Creating notification when proposal approved.
  * If I am one of several approvers at a routing stop where only one approval is required, (need the system to check if the peopleflow map stop is set to all or first and only perform notification if first) I need to be notified if another user has approved a proposal where I am either primary or alternate.
  * Currently, there is no notification available to provide this service. This means users have to check every notice in their action list.
  * MIT Coeus notification engine provided this type of message and it is immensely important to the campus business process.
  * When a proposal is routing, it often routes to a People Flow (routing map) containing a Primary Approver and at least one Secondary Approver. When someone on the People Flow approves the proposal, an email notification to the Other Approvers listed on the People Flow (but who did not approve the proposal) should be sent to let them know this proposal was already approved. This email notification should not be sent to the Approver who approved the proposal.
  * The email notification subject line should contain a subject line "Proposal _____ Approved by Other User", and the information in the email should contain the Proposal #, PI Name, Unit Name, and Proposal Title.
  * Please execute this in the notification service so that the message body can be changes and implementers can choose if the message is active and or requires a prompt window at action or approved by another

* RESKC-918: Reject notification
  * As one of several approvers at a routing stop, I need to be notified if another user has rejected a proposal where I am either primary or alternate approver.
  * Currently, there is no notification available to provide this service. This means users have to check every notice in their action list.
  * MIT Coeus notification engine provided this type of message and it is immensely important to the campus business process.
  * When a proposal is routing, it often routes to a People Flow (routing map) containing a Primary Approver and at least one Secondary Approver. When someone on the People Flow rejects the proposal, an email notification to the Other Approvers listed on the People Flow (but who did not approve the proposal) should be sent to let them know this proposal was already rejected. This email notification should *not *be sent to the Approver who to the action to reject the proposal.
  * This notification should support the standard ability to customize the Subject Line as well as adding supplemental text to the body of the email.
  * For example, MIT would customize the email notification subject line to " PI Name's Proposal # has been returned to the Aggregator by another User", and the information in the email will contain the pre-programed details: Proposal #, PI Name, Unit Name, and Proposal Title.
  * The attached template includes how MIT would customize this email notification for reference.
  * This issue is related to RESKC-701, another notification MIT utilizes to support routing notifications.

##coeus-1601.75
* RESKC-671: Adding ability to change proposal person role after addition. Cannot reproduce the STE mentioned so added test to verify.
  * Duplicated in res-test1.
  * Created initiating child proposal #6379 with PI user rhanlon
  * Created parent #6380. Using Summary/submit screen, confirmed rhanlon was PI in both parent and child.
  * Key Persons> deleted rhanlon as PI, searched and added Eagle as PI.
  * Synced to parent.
  * On Summary/Submit screen: Eagle was listed as Co-i on Parent proposal, and PI on child.
  * Using the Toolbar> Hierarchy> I tried to unlink the proposal from the parent. I got an STE. see comments.
  * In a Proposal Hierarchy, the PI on the Child proposal that creates the Parent proposal, becomes the lead PI on the Parent proposal. However, if after creating the Parent proposal, the PI changes and the user goes to the Child Proposal and changes the PI there first and syncs the change to the Parent proposal. The 'old' PI is removed (or role is modified - depending on the change made) from the Parent proposal BUT the new PI that was designated, synced as a Co-Investigator to the Parent proposal. This resulted in the Parent not having a PI - no matter what the user did (everyone appeared as a Co-Investigator or Key Person). We tried deleting and adding people back in and syncing and nothing work.
  * This happened in Production last week - DBA had to change the Role assignment for the PI in the Database.
  * Desired Behavior: If there is a PI change on the Child proposal that created the Parent proposal, the system should sync that change to the Parent proposal - assigning the PI role and NOT as Co-Investigator on the Parent proposal.
  * WORK AROUND: Create a new parent from the corrected lead child proposal.
  * Steps to Reproduce:
  * 1.    Create a Proposal (with minimum info to save)
  * 2.    Add a PI in the Key Personnel section
  * 3.    Create/add Budget (no need to add any costs - budget just needs to be initiated to create/link hierarchy)
  * 4.    In the Budget, click the Return to proposal button
  * 5.    In the Proposal, click the Hierarchy link in the toolbar. In the Hierarchy window select:
  * a.    Hierarchy Budget Type: Sub Budget
  * b.    Click the Create Hierarchy button
  * c.    Note the Parent Proposal number generated
  * d.    Close out of your proposal
  * 6.    Go to the Parent Proposal and navigate to the Key Personnel section. You should see the Person you designed as the PI in your Child proposal, appear as the PI in your Parent proposal
  * 7.    Close out of the Parent proposal
  * 8.    Navigate back to your Child Proposal and go to the Key Personnel Section
  * 9.    In the Key Personnel Section, delete the current PI
  * 10.   Add a different person as the new PI and save
  * 11.   Click the Hierarchy (C) link in the toolbar. In the Hierarchy window:
  * a.    Click the Sync Hierarchy button. (You should get a Synchronization successful message)
  * 12.   Navigate to the Parent Proposal -> Key Personnel section
  * 13.   You will see that the old PI that you deleted from the Child proposal, was removed from the Parent proposal.
  * 14.   BUT the new Person you added to the child proposal as the new PI, synced to the Parent as a Co-Investigator. - see Parent Proposal Number 27528 in KC QA
  * (There is no way from this point on, to get someone to appear as the PI on that Parent Proposal. Other individuals from the any additional child proposals will automatically sync as Co-Investigators or Key Persons.)
  * The only work-around for this is to unlink and create a new Proposal Hierarchy with the correct PI or have the role assignment changed by DB Admin.
  * MITKC-2033
  * ISSUE #2
  * STE upon trying to unlink the child proposal after changing the PI from Hanlon to Eagle, now Eagle as Co-I in parent and PI in only child:

* RESKC-1097: In Proposal Dev, Proposal Hierarchy Parent Budget cost share lines are being duplicated in Institutional Commitments.

  * In Proposal Dev, Proposal Hierarchy Parent Budget cost share lines are being duplicated in Institutional Commitments > Cost Sharing when the Hierarchy > Sync All action is taken at the parent budget level.

  * Each time the sync is performed, additional lines are pulled into the distribution screen, rather than the existing ones being updated (or all deleted then written anew from the child budgets upon sync).

  * This does NOT happen when the Budget > Hierarchy > Sync to parent action is taken from an individual child. However, there are scenarios when it is not feasible to sync individually from each child rather than from the parent, particularly when children are from different units with different aggregators.

*Desired result:*
  * Syncing All from Hierarchy Parent Budget should not add new rows to those already existing at the parent budget Commitments - Cost Sharing.
  * Sync All from Parent Budget should remove all existing rows replace with the current rows from each child proposal budget with cost sharing commitments entered.

  * Steps to reproduce:

  * Create a 2 year proposal with basic information
  * Key person: PI
  * Create a Budget: add non-personnel line item at $1000, in Details, add same $1000 amount in the Cost Sharing field. Unclick the "Apply Inflation" for the line item.
  * Autogenerate periods.
  * On Commitments > Cost Sharing, enter source account as "1234567" in a row for each year for the $1000 direct costs; leave unit number blank and percentage at 0% (MIT does not usually use).
  * Add an additional row for each period for the F&A amount ($5,600 at in MIT KC WKLy): enter source account as 1402600 (all MIT uses this account for Cost Sharing F&A); leave unit number blank and percentage at 0%
  * Complete the budget.
  * Return to the proposal >
  * Toolbar > Hierarchy > create a parent with this proposal as sub-budget. Make note of the parent proposal number.
  * Toolbar > Copy > copy this proposal including the budget.

  * In the new proposal > toolbar > budget versions >Open the budget.
  * In the cost sharing distribution, change the source account for the direct costs lines for each year to "7654321".
  * Save and mark the budget as for submission and complete. (it is identical to first proposal, except for the Cost sharing direct cost source code).
  * Make a note of this child #2 proposal number.
  * Save and close proposal.

  * Open the Parent proposal .
  * Proposal Details > Toolbar > Hierarchy >  select sub-budget, enter second child proposal number and click Link a child to this Parent> Link a child to this Parent.
  * Open Budget.
  * Note Cost Sharing total by year in Periods and Totals.
  * Go to Commitments > Cost Sharing > Summary. Ensure same as the P&T amounts.
  * Note number of lines in distribution.
  * Still in budget -  Toolbar > Hierarchy >  Sync All.

  * Return to Commitments > Cost Sharing -- note that number of lines has increased, but Summary total has remained the same as have P&T total cost sharing.

  * Try to mark Budget Complete -- error regarding need to allocate all cost sharing funds will be received.

  * Turn on Validations - same error will be received.

  * Try Sync All again - it does not fix the problem but brings in yet more duplicate rows.

* RESKC-1095:PD Budget: new validation to enforce Proposal and Budget Start/End dates breaks several business processes

  * The current fix does not allow the flexibility needed for different types of proposal submissions to comply with sponsor requested preparation (e.g. supplement proposals where the entire project period is to be entered in the proposal but the budget is to include on the start and end date covering the supplemental funds spending), or for syncing child proposal budget date changes to a hierarchy.

  * The validation needs to be changed from requiring budget start and end dates to match the proposal start and end dates to instead enforcing that the budget start date falls after the proposal start date and the budget end date falls before the proposal period end date.
  * The budget start and end dates must both fall within the project period, rather than match exactly.

*  RESKC-1058: The subrecipient DUNS number needs to display on screen near the other FAIN information related to Uniform Guidance to ease reporting.

  * The field for subrecpient's display of name was not large enough to accomodate the DUNS as well. Therefore, we should move that field to the bottom of the section so that the area can expand to show the DUNS and subrecipient name in one location. This would seperate the Subrecipient from the Sub Investigator however, so we also require that the sub Investigator move to be directly above the new subrecipient display placement. To do that, we will move the execution date to the former placement of the subrecipient.

* PD - COI Disclosure Status button and Window should display if logic requires certification

  * This is a business process requirement.
  * The COI Disclosure status button and window should display if any and all logic triggers the requirement for any proposal person to certify (sponsor hierarchy, PCK flag, proposal types, etc).
  * The button should display when personnel are added to the proposal.
  * When opened the window should remain unpopulated unless and until a proposal person answers with a Yes to one of the COI screening questions in proposal certifications maintained in PROP_PERSON_COI_CERTIFY_QID.

  * Currently the COI Disclosure status button will not display until a person has answered a yes to one of the COI screening questions in proposal certifications. Showing no COI Disclosure Status button is confusing as could mean no requirement for certification by logic or by a persons answers. The window should display if logic requires certification by any proposal persons.

* IP & Award: System is allowing users to edit prior document versions when a later version of the document exists.

  * The system is allowing users to edit prior Institutional and Award document Versions but it does not pull in the data from the latest finalized version.

  * For example, in the Institutional Proposal module, if I edit an IP record - the correct Version number gets assigned regardless of what version I click the [edit] button in. However, I noticed that the information in the newly created version pulls in from the IP version I have clicked the [edit] button in and NOT from the latest finalized IP version that exists. (SAME IS HAPPENING IN THE AWARD).

  * For example, let's assume I have an IP that has a latest finalized Version 3 with title 'Kat - Version 3'. I edit that version to create Version 4 with title 'Kat - Version 4' and finalize that. I then go back to Version 3 and I edit that version, KC will assign the correct Version number (Version 5), however, the title that will pull in will be 'Kat - Version 3' and not 'Kat - Version 4'.

  * If a user jots down a doc number – they won’t look to see if a later version exists so we will run into wrong data being pulled into the IPs and Awards. To avoid this problem, the system should only allow users to EDIT the LATEST FINALIZED VERSION. Prior document versions should NOT have an [edit] button.

  * 	Click [Assign to Period 1] 
  * 	Click the Details & Rate link for the Faculty Salaries Tenured – On
  * Object Code and review Rate Tab (you should see amounts for Employee
  * Benefits – Research Rate, and MTDC)
  * o	Save your budget and click the [Return to proposal] button
  * Back in the Proposal, click the Hierarchy link located in the Toolbar.
  * In the Hierarchy window:
  * Hierarchy Budget Type: Sub-Budget
  * Click the [Create Hierarchy] button. The Parent proposal will be created
  * – note the parent proposal number
  * Close out of the Proposal
  * B.	Create Child Proposal 2 and Link it to Parent Proposal created in A:

  * When viewing personnel item Details & Rates, when the Default or Custom Group includes entries from multiple children, the Details & Rates only reflects the amounts from the child budget that created the parent. The info from the other personnel items are not reflected. (This seems to be happening in all hierarchy proposals - not just the ones with LA and non-LA units)
  * (Only if each child budget has separate Custom Group(s) they used for entering each of their shared person cost element types, then it shows correctly in the details & rates. Or, if there is a Default or Custom group (g/l or cost element) that contains only salaries from one child, and there are no personnel from the other children in that cost element/category, then it displays correctly.)  * Gayathri Athreya on Tue, 29 Nov 2016 14:05:59 -0700 [View Commit](../../commit/8031d630c496f35bd36bfcabfb427578284d9c29)

##coeus-1610.0021
* RESKC-1586: Integration Test and fix. (#2018)

  * In a Proposal Hierarchy, If a non-lead child proposal has a PI which is different from the Parent PI, and that person has only one unit associated, then after linking to the hierarchy, syncing all from the parent and then running the data validations
  * Bug: The Data Validation is deleting that person's unit.
  * Turn Validation off and the unit is still not appearing. The unit is not deleted from the child proposal.
  * Workaround - user can manually re-add the unit at the parent and then the unit stays associated even after data validation is turned on.
  * Requirement
  * Hierarchy Proposal Investigator Units	The system shall display all of the units listed in any of the child proposals as associated with the Co-Investigators. - the parent proposal should update (even with sync) to show all co-I units from all child proposals
  * The proposal hierarchy summary should show the parent as updating with additional units from personnel on child proposals.
  * Technical Details:
  * ProposalDevelopmentKeyPersonsRule.processSaveKeyPersonBusinessRules() removes the lead unit from non-PIs. The validation shouldn't be causing a side-effect, but it is. What it's checking for is whether or not the person is listed as a PI. If they are not the PI, then it checks to see if any of the unit are listed as the lead unit and removes them. This covers the case when a PI is down-graded to a Co-I and should follow the new PI. However, this breaks on hierarchy sync because the PIs from the non-primary children become Co-Is on the parent. When we sync the people in the hierarchy, we should also be setting leadUnit = false on all of their associated units.

  * Losing access to some of the left-hand navigation buttons, including Delivery Info, Budget, Access, Summary/Submit, etc. when page footer floats and does not allow user to scroll past.
  * I believe it IS happening consistently when both left nav sections that have sub sections are open; so when both Basics and Key Personnel are open and showing sub menu options.
  * Only workaround we have identified is to keep clicking nav buttons toward the top of the list which refreshes the screen until the issue resolves.

* RESKC-1308: Fix IP to Award data feed. (#1723)

  * System is ignoring the parameter setting for All_Sponsor_Hierarchy_NIH_Multiple_PI = Y.
  * While it presents and allows the user to select PI/Multiple in IP and Award, and appears to add that participant, the person is not fully saved in the record.
  * Their section 'disappears' on the Contacts screen, but the validation for Credit Split persists if that feature is enabled.
  * Fix must resolve the following:
  * 1. IP should not ignore the All Sponsor PI Multiple parameter
  * 2. Award should not ignore the All Sponsor PI Multiple parameeter
  * 3. When IP fed as funding source to Award, system should not ignore PI Multiple.
  * 
  * In stage:
  * Award created and added IP *3284 as funding source which brings in 2 contacts: PI Maher and PI/Multi Majumdar.
  * Added required fields to save; added template.
  * Contacts screen: found Maher as PI, but Majumdar imports as a Key Person (SHOULD BE PI/Multiple).
  * Test 1: Actions > Submit - got validation error re: credit split not = 100.
  * Returned to Contacts: Majumdar was no longer visible on screen. Stuck - cancelled award.
  * Test 2: recreated the award with the same funding proposal.
  * On Contacts: DELETED Majumdar key person. Searched and added back as PI/Multiple. Saved,
  * Again - Majumdar info on Contact screen disappears.
  * Cannot submit award due to persistent validation error for credit split - so the person is still in the record.  * Gayathri Athreya on Thu, 5 May 2016 12:03:47 -0700 [View Commit](../../commit/40d827095a73765ae8f2cc0c0e18b1c8a41798ea)

  * As a Negotiation Administrator, I only want active values to appear in the drop-down lists when I create or edit a negotiation so that I don't incorrectly select an inactive value.
  * 
  * Steps to recreate issue:
  * 1. System Admin Portal > Negotiations > Negotiation Activity Type (or Negotiation Location)
  * 2. Click to open the Lookup window
  * 3. Click on "Both" for the Active field to locate all values (active & inactive)
  * 4. Click search
  * 5. Note any that are Inactive (Active column = "No") and if all are Active, edit one to make it Inactive
  * 6. KRAD Porgal > Central Admin > Preaward > Negotations
  * 7. When in the Negotiation Document, click show on Activities & Attachments panel.
  * 8. Click Show to open the Add Activity.
  * 9. Click on the drop down for Activity Type (or Location)
  * RESULT: Inactive value is appearing in the drop-down list for Activity Type (or Location).
  * EXPECTED RESULT: Only active values should appear in drop-down lists.  * Travis Schneeberger on Fri, 29 Apr 2016 21:43:21 -0400 [View Commit](../../commit/067b4a8a8d1f30ccddb65154200fc62ba5dc1edb)
* RESKC-1211: IRB and IACUC FYI process enhancement

  * Problem: IRB was not always easily able to keep track of all notify IRB (FYI) actions, because admin only needs to acknowledge. This does not support a process where IRB admins often need to go back and forth with PI/Dept Admin to get needed documentation.
  * Contributed Solution:
  * -Model a special routing for the FYI/ Notify IRB process to be similar to the amendment protocol process, except does not allow modification of the protocol itself other than notes and attachments.
  * -IRB can now obtain more information and even approve/disapprove action.
  * -Upon approve the attachments role into the notes and attachments history for tracking.
  * -Parameterized.
  * -IACUC is also addressed.
  * This enhancement was discussed and approved by the KCC IRB subcommittee in 05/2014. Foundation Jira is KRAFDBCK-10691. Also, was shared with the IACUC Subcommittee.

  * When viewing the Medusa tab from either an Award or IP when there is a linked Subaward, the incorrect Subaward Data is displayed and the "open subaward" button opens the wrong Subaward.
  * There are a few related JIRAs (774, 894, 743) but I do not see any that address the fact that the incorrect Subaward data is displayed and link is broken. This seems to only occur in Award and IP (in other modules incorrect ID is also displayed but link and info is correct).
  * This occurs in Test Drive 1604.28 and our local 1512 environment.
  * To duplicate this issue consistently. In the database, SUBAWARD_ID is actually a different value than Subaward ID in the application (Subaward ID in application = SUBAWARD_CODE in db). It appears as if Medusa tab for Award and IP display both values and the info displayed and open button are linked to the SUBAWARD_ID and not SUBAWARD_CODE in database.  * Gayathri Athreya on Mon, 25 Apr 2016 14:12:44 -0700 [View Commit](../../commit/d3d18780ecfc25c9a45a2fdd2d20be995f0b05fb)

  * General Acceptance Criteria:
  * Configurable in monolith so it is only displayed in a module if desired by the school.
  * For each project person, display the latest status of the annual disclosure that includes that project.
  * if the project is not on annual yet, display "Not yet disclosed"
  * if a project is not required to disclose display "Disclosure Not Required"
  * Acceptance Criteria:
  * Admin can configure IRB to link with new COI module

  * ALWAYS ASK	5	Does the proposed project involve human embryonic stem cells?
  * IF YES	6	Can a specific stem cell line be referenced at this time? If stem cells will be used, but a specific line cannot be referenced at the time of application submission, include a statement that one from the registry will be used.

  * -Issue One Result: You should be able to select reviewers but they are not appearing as part of the submit screen unless you have selected a schedule.
  * -Expected: A schedule should not be required for selecting reviewers if the review type is exempt (or expedited). Expedited is behaving correctly.
  * Submit the protocol without the schedule
  * Then assign a reviewer via Assign Reviewers action
  * -Issue Two result: The review assignment is saved but the Review tab does not appear. See screen shot
  * -Expected: The protocol review tab should appear

Moved sorting the list from java to database. Added cache for holding amendements and renewals for each protocol for two minutes. Fixed jsp tags where it was calling getter of amendementRenewal in a loop unnecessarily. As part of this optimization, removed the section of displaying proposal summary for each amendment.

* RESKC-904:Fixed obligated amounts datatype.

  * In the Award Budget, the user must budget to exactly match the Obligated Total in order to submit the budget.
  * Currently, the system displays the Obligated Total rounded to whole dollar values in several fields:
  * > in the Non-Personnel Budget Overview
  * > rebudget >  line item detail if cents were in original item.

  * In Res demo 1: Award 000295-00001
  * Award budget versions screen displays the actual Obligated 144,638.69
  * Non-Personnel Budget Overview displays 144,639
  * (my expenses were full dollar amounts, so I did not see the rounding in the obligated column in the line item detail, but I expect this to be consistent with MIT's report.)

  * Desired Result: NONE of the Obligated total fields in Award Budget should round: they should ALWAYS display the exact value as this is the target amount the users must reach.

  * In an example budget, the obligated amount from Version 1 in the first screenshot (MITKC 2231a) does not match the obligated amount in Version 2 in the second screen shot (MITKC 2231b)
  * Version 1  award budget non-personnel tab displays "1686.00" for obligated amount (ROUNDED)
  * Version 2 award budget non-personnel tab displays for obligated amt 1685.51. (Actual obligated amount)

  * Calculations are correct, display is wrong. There should NOT be rounding.

  * Go to Budget Notes.
  * In the Notes field, PASTE in some text from a MSWord doc with some special formatting like curly quotes, curly apostrophes, or em-dashes.

  * Select Budget version from top menu bar, select Actions > Mark Budget complete for this budget.
  * Close budget (by closing browser window if necessary).
  * Open proposal to edit. Go to Summary Submit screen. Select [Submit For Review]
  * Result: the validation error message appears.

  * DESIRED RESULTS:
  * 1. Eliminate the Error. Budget Notes are not utilized in S2S submissions where special text is a problem, so any entries should be allowed as long as they are compatible with the database. There is no need to validate this so strictly. Warn the user: "*Pasted in text may include formatting that will not appear, please use plain text or manually type in the notes. *"
  * 2. Alternative: reduce it to a warning.

* RESKC-1132: Fixed proposal development document when recalled.

  * Proposal Status is "Approval Pending" instead of "Revisions Requested" on proposals recalled during routing
  * Proposal Routed for approval and was Recalled before the Investigator approved.
  * When in the same session, the submit status changed to save and the document became editable, user navigated to the key personnel section, searched for and added a multi-pi. selected the person certifications and noticed that answers to questions were not editable.
  * Left proposal and searched for proposal in proposal search.
  * Can edit some areas of proposal persons (such as commons name) but cannot certify the newly added multipi. Document status shows as approval pending and submit screen shows as saved (not routing)
  * Route log shows that the initiator recalled the proposal
  * yet the proposal is not entirely editable and the document status is incorrectly approval pending
  * To reproduce:
  * Searched for Proposal enroute that was awaiting PI approval
  * Clicked Edit from Search Results
  * Went to Submit on left Nav
  * Recalled
  * added Recall reason
  * navigated to key persons
  * added key person to Multi PI role
  * Closed.
  * Searched for PD again
  * Edit proposal
  * proposal shows as approval in progress and is not completely editable

* RESKC-1203: Recalculating budget periods if posted budget exists.

  * On an award we are not able to create a new budget revision because it gives us an error "Period 2 end date cannot exceed project end date" But we can not change this in any way. The project was shortened after the previous budget was posted but now it will not allow us to rebudget using the new date. Please advise as how we should accomplish this and why this is a problem.
steps to reproduce
  * Create an award,
  * create an award budget,
  * approve, post.
  * Via T&M document,
  * change award dates
  * now try to create a new budget, get error message.

* Copied awards with multiple award amount info errors on save

  * Awards copied that contain multiple award amount infos from a time and money document fail on initial save with the following error.
  * ```
  * org.springframework.dao.DataIntegrityViolationException: OJB operation; SQL []; Column 'AWARD_NUMBER' cannot be null; nested exception is com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException: Column 'AWARD_NUMBER' cannot be null
  * ```
  * This was because the indexOfAwardAmountInfoToDisplay would get set during versioning/sequencing due to a lazy initializer. After the versioning the amount info list is truncated leaving the indexOfAmountInfoToDisplay at a much higher number than exists. Then the KNS view of the initial page would populate the awardAmountInfo list with new, uninitialized values. Attempting to save these new items would throw the exception above.

* RESKC-1179: Fixed hierarchy org issue.

  * A user creates a proposal hierarchy with at least two proposals. The proposal is finalized and submitted for routing. User realizes that the budget entries mean that there should be "other organizations" listed. User recalls the proposal.
  * User navigates to the parent proposal and then to the organization section, other organization tab. User searches for and adds four organizations. Save and Continue and all seems fine, as soon as the user chooses another tab in the left navigation there is a STE.
  * User expects to see new organizations added, and be able to navigate normally with the ability to re-submit for review.
steps to reproduce
  * Hierarchy had been successfully created, routed, and then returned for revisions.
  * With PD Status of Revisions Requested, DLC user had gone into Parent to edit and add several "Other Organizations" in Organization and Location section at request of OSP Approver.
  * User successfully added 4 Other Organizations.
  * Then began getting Incident reports with every attempt at navigating in the PD while editing.
  * When opened with Edit on Basics > Proposal Details screen, any attempt at navigating results in an Incident report, even simply clicking Proposal Details (the same screen user is on).
  * NOTE - at parent, when user opens in View and navigates to the Organizations & Locations, the Applicant Organization and Performing Organization tabs are both blank. This is normally populated with data by default. Child proposals still have this filled with data.

* RESKC-1038: When attempting to add an Activity or modify Activity End date, user receives incorrect validation message if Activity End Date is later than Negotiation End Date.

  * Message says "Activity End Date must be the same or later than the Activity Start Date". This message is incorrect and only way to resolve is to fix Negotiation End Date or Activity End Date (not Activity Start Date). This affects "Complete" Negotiation docs.
  * Steps to Reproduce
  * 1. Open/Create and complete Negotiation doc (End Date listed).
  * 2. Add/Modify Activity with Activity End Date later than Negotiation End Date (but with Activity Start Date before Activity End Date)
  * 3. Validation will say that Activity Start date must be before Activity End Date, even though it already is.
  * 4. Extend Negotiation End Date or shorten Activity End date to fix error.
  * Expected: The system should be checking if the activity end date is >= to the activity start date and show the message "Activity End Date must be the same or later than the Activity Start Date" whenever that is not true. Activity dates should not run against the Negotiation Dates
  * It seems like the error message that is displaying is for another situation

* RESKC-1152: Added new KRMS functions for award, PD, IP and IRB

  * This contribution is a series of KRMS functions for use in a variety of modules as well as the code necessary to allow functions in IP to work properly.  That code was left out of IP and Subaward when KRMS was linked to those modules.

  * Included Functions:

  * IRB: Does the Protocol contain a specified participant type?:  This function takes a parameter that is the participant type code or label and then returns true if any members of that participant type are included in the protocol.

  * How many participants does Protocol have of Type(_)?: This function accepts a participating type code or description and then returns a number equal to the number of participants of that type listed in the protocol.  This allows the user to use a variety of comparison operands with this function such as > < or =.

  * Check Protocol has Amendment Section(_): This function checks to see if a certain section of the protocol is being modified by an amendment and then returns true if it is.  It accepts the application labels for the various amendment sections listed in the protocol amendment action panel.

  * Check Protocol has Funding Source with Sponsor Type(_): This accepts a sponsor type label or code and then returns true if a funding source of sponsor is listed with a sponsor of that type.  It does not check the sponsor on linked grants documents.

  * Check if Base Protocol has Last Approval Date: This function will return true if the base protocol associated with a given document has a "Last Approval Date" listed.

  * Check if Sponsor and Prime Sponsor are the same: This function will return true if the sponsor and prime sponsor in a document are the same.  This function is being submitted for PD, IP and Award.  This is to accommodate schools that do not want prime sponsor listed if there is not one.

  * Check if Award has a Comment Entered of Type(_): This function is setup for Award and accepts Comment Type Code.  If there is any text in that comment for the award document it will return true.  This is to accomodate schools that have KFS integration turned on and want to check for fields that are required for account setup, but not OOB Award setup before an award is finalized to minimize award correction.

  * Check if Award/IP has a special review with the specified type(_) This accepts a special review type code and will return true if the award/IP has a special review entry listed of that type.

  * Check if Property has changed since the previous award version(_) This award function accepts a Property name.  It will return true if that field has changed since the last version of the award.  This will accept any variable name that can be used by the Term Specification property system, but the variable doesn't have to be setup in advance as a property.  If there are certain values in an award that are not supposed to be changed by general staff this is a good way to catch data entry errors.

  * Check Previous Version has Property matching value(_,_): This award function accepts a property name that follows the same variable rules as the last function.  It also accepts a value.  If any previous version of the award has that value then it will return true.  At IU there are certain things the staff are not supposed to change once an award has been made active.  They have more leeway to make changes while an award is in pre-award expenditure or pending status.  This allowed us to build validations based on those fields.  We specifically didn't hard code this to those fields so it could be flexible for other schools to utilize for other purposes.

  * Check if IP has a fiscal month the same as the current fiscal month: This will return true if the fiscal month is the same as the one listed on the IP.  This basically checks to see if the IP was finalized in a previous fiscal month.  This was necessary to prevent the alteration of certain data in historic records.

All Key Personnel listed on Proposal should populate on an initiated institute proposal, and all personnel on an institutional proposal should populate on a linked award. The person in the Multi-PI role is currently dropped from award completely. They must still appear with the same role as from institutional proposal.

* RESKC-1162: Added tests
  * Gayathri Athreya on Tue, 9 Feb 2016 20:58:52 -0700 [View Commit](../../commit/b2126c699796405a60314484751b86b79cfd0d76)
* RESKC-1162, Proposal Hierarchy does not delete personnel attachment from parent, Sync on non-employee personnel attachments cause an STE, In the Personnel Attachments Screen, when the User adds Personnel and their corresponding attachments, then clicks Save, the Personnel name disappears.

  * Steps to reproduce RESKC-1162:
  * 1) create a proposal.
  * 2) add two persons
  * 3) add a biosketch attachment for each person (two in total)
  * 4) save
  * 5) add budget
  * 6) return to proposal
  * 7) create sub budget hierarchy
  * 8) close child, open parent, confirm the two biosketch attachments exist on the parent
  * 9) close parent, open child
  * 10) delete one biosketch attachment
  * 11) save
  * 12) sync to parent
  * 13) close child, open parent
  * you will notice the parent still has two biosketch attachments even though it should only have one attachment.

  * Steps to reproduce 
  * 1) add non employee Key Person to a child in a hierarchy, save
  * 2) sync to parent
  * 3) close child
  * 4) open parent
  * 5) confirm the Key Person is listed at the parent
  * 6) close parent
  * 7) open child
  * 8) add a biosketch attachments for this KP at the child, save
  * 9) either:  sync to parent
  * STE 1 results.
  * OR close child. open parent. Sync All from parent.
  * STE 2 Results
  * you will notice both attachments are still on the parent.

  * Steps to reproduce 
  * To reproduce:
  * Create a proposal, or find one that is In Progress to edit.
  * if new proposal, enter the required fields to save.
  * Navigate to Key Personnel screen.
  * if new proposal, add personnel, and search for an Employee and add them as PI
  * Click Add Personnel> click 'Non Employee' to search the Address Book
  * locate and add the address book person as a co-investigator
  * Navigate to Attachments,
  * Select Personnel tab> Click Add
  * Choose the Address book Person from dropdown list
  * Add File and Description
  * At this point the name will be visible in the list of Personnel (FIG 1)
  * Click Save and the names disappear. (FIG 2)

  * Other issues also fixed:

  * 1) when a duplicate personnel attachment exists across child proposals, syncing from the parent will cause the duplicates to show up on the parent. Syncing from a child will filter out the duplicates. This is now corrected.
  * 2) non employee personnel attachments do not show the proposal person name
  * 3) non employee personnel attachments do not allow edits on the parent when duplicates exist on children. This differs from how employee personnel attachments work when duplicates exist on children.
  * 4) non employee personnel attachments can be added and maintained at the parent even when duplicates do not exist
  * 5) when a duplicate personnel attachment exists across child proposals, the child attachments should not be editable. This is correct exception the description textarea is still editable

  * -Institute LA Rate > search
  * or Miscellaneous > Unit Hierarchy > [rates] or [LA rates] button(s)
  * Perform a rate search using one of the above navigation paths.
  * In the result set: Select either Edit or Copy of a particular rate.
  * Result: The selected rate type will NOT open (unless it is the first action of the day after a rebuild).

* RESKC-1145: Added fringe totals to exclusion list when Overhead not applied.
  * In KC budget, in the line item details (both in Non-Personnel Costs and SPE screens) or personnel group Details & Rates, if you uncheck the "Apply Rate" box for MTDC, the IDC in the budget is correctly adjusted to exclude the unchecked amounts.
  * However, when you print the budget forms, the calculated fringe amount is not listed in the Page 2: Calculation Methodology: exclusions. When Personnel expenses use the 'unapply rate' option, the _salary _is listed as excluded, but associated fringes are not there.
  * The correct BASE does appear in the next section (F&A Cost Rates and Base), and is correct Page 1.
  * But a user should be able to manually calculate the Base by subtracting the Total exclusions from the F&A Base from the Total Direct Costs. We cannot get to this value the way the report prints today.
  * Steps to reproduce:
  * Create a budget for a research proposal
  * Add a Personnel, and assign them to the period.
  * Once added, click Details & Rates to open that window. Click on the Rates tab and uncheck the "Apply" box for MTDC. Save.
  * Save ( you can autogenerate periods or just review P1)
  * Toolbar > Budget Versions > Print > #4 Budget Summary Report > Create PDF.
  * ON p2 in the methodology - review the total exclusions to F&A.
  * Notice: the salary row appears in the list exclusions, but the calculated fringe does not.
  * Subtract that Total Exclusions value from the Total Direct Costs on P1.
  * Review the F&A Base in the next section on the form: it does not match your calculated amount.

* RESKC-701: Creating notification when proposal approved.
  * If I am one of several approvers at a routing stop where only one approval is required, (need the system to check if the peopleflow map stop is set to all or first and only perform notification if first) I need to be notified if another user has approved a proposal where I am either primary or alternate.
  * Currently, there is no notification available to provide this service. This means users have to check every notice in their action list.
  * MIT Coeus notification engine provided this type of message and it is immensely important to the campus business process.
  * When a proposal is routing, it often routes to a People Flow (routing map) containing a Primary Approver and at least one Secondary Approver. When someone on the People Flow approves the proposal, an email notification to the Other Approvers listed on the People Flow (but who did not approve the proposal) should be sent to let them know this proposal was already approved. This email notification should not be sent to the Approver who approved the proposal.
  * The email notification subject line should contain a subject line "Proposal _____ Approved by Other User", and the information in the email should contain the Proposal #, PI Name, Unit Name, and Proposal Title.
  * Please execute this in the notification service so that the message body can be changes and implementers can choose if the message is active and or requires a prompt window at action or approved by another

* RESKC-918: Reject notification
  * As one of several approvers at a routing stop, I need to be notified if another user has rejected a proposal where I am either primary or alternate approver.
  * Currently, there is no notification available to provide this service. This means users have to check every notice in their action list.
  * MIT Coeus notification engine provided this type of message and it is immensely important to the campus business process.
  * When a proposal is routing, it often routes to a People Flow (routing map) containing a Primary Approver and at least one Secondary Approver. When someone on the People Flow rejects the proposal, an email notification to the Other Approvers listed on the People Flow (but who did not approve the proposal) should be sent to let them know this proposal was already rejected. This email notification should *not *be sent to the Approver who to the action to reject the proposal.
  * This notification should support the standard ability to customize the Subject Line as well as adding supplemental text to the body of the email.
  * For example, MIT would customize the email notification subject line to " PI Name's Proposal # has been returned to the Aggregator by another User", and the information in the email will contain the pre-programed details: Proposal #, PI Name, Unit Name, and Proposal Title.
  * The attached template includes how MIT would customize this email notification for reference.
  * This issue is related to RESKC-701, another notification MIT utilizes to support routing notifications.

##coeus-1601.75
* RESKC-671: Adding ability to change proposal person role after addition. Cannot reproduce the STE mentioned so added test to verify.
  * Duplicated in res-test1.
  * Created initiating child proposal #6379 with PI user rhanlon
  * Created parent #6380. Using Summary/submit screen, confirmed rhanlon was PI in both parent and child.
  * Key Persons> deleted rhanlon as PI, searched and added Eagle as PI.
  * Synced to parent.
  * On Summary/Submit screen: Eagle was listed as Co-i on Parent proposal, and PI on child.
  * Using the Toolbar> Hierarchy> I tried to unlink the proposal from the parent. I got an STE. see comments.
  * In a Proposal Hierarchy, the PI on the Child proposal that creates the Parent proposal, becomes the lead PI on the Parent proposal. However, if after creating the Parent proposal, the PI changes and the user goes to the Child Proposal and changes the PI there first and syncs the change to the Parent proposal. The 'old' PI is removed (or role is modified - depending on the change made) from the Parent proposal BUT the new PI that was designated, synced as a Co-Investigator to the Parent proposal. This resulted in the Parent not having a PI - no matter what the user did (everyone appeared as a Co-Investigator or Key Person). We tried deleting and adding people back in and syncing and nothing work.
  * This happened in Production last week - DBA had to change the Role assignment for the PI in the Database.
  * Desired Behavior: If there is a PI change on the Child proposal that created the Parent proposal, the system should sync that change to the Parent proposal - assigning the PI role and NOT as Co-Investigator on the Parent proposal.
  * WORK AROUND: Create a new parent from the corrected lead child proposal.
  * Steps to Reproduce:
  * 1.    Create a Proposal (with minimum info to save)
  * 2.    Add a PI in the Key Personnel section
  * 3.    Create/add Budget (no need to add any costs - budget just needs to be initiated to create/link hierarchy)
  * 4.    In the Budget, click the Return to proposal button
  * 5.    In the Proposal, click the Hierarchy link in the toolbar. In the Hierarchy window select:
  * a.    Hierarchy Budget Type: Sub Budget
  * b.    Click the Create Hierarchy button
  * c.    Note the Parent Proposal number generated
  * d.    Close out of your proposal
  * 6.    Go to the Parent Proposal and navigate to the Key Personnel section. You should see the Person you designed as the PI in your Child proposal, appear as the PI in your Parent proposal
  * 7.    Close out of the Parent proposal
  * 8.    Navigate back to your Child Proposal and go to the Key Personnel Section
  * 9.    In the Key Personnel Section, delete the current PI
  * 10.   Add a different person as the new PI and save
  * 11.   Click the Hierarchy (C) link in the toolbar. In the Hierarchy window:
  * a.    Click the Sync Hierarchy button. (You should get a Synchronization successful message)
  * 12.   Navigate to the Parent Proposal -> Key Personnel section
  * 13.   You will see that the old PI that you deleted from the Child proposal, was removed from the Parent proposal.
  * 14.   BUT the new Person you added to the child proposal as the new PI, synced to the Parent as a Co-Investigator. - see Parent Proposal Number 27528 in KC QA
  * (There is no way from this point on, to get someone to appear as the PI on that Parent Proposal. Other individuals from the any additional child proposals will automatically sync as Co-Investigators or Key Persons.)
  * The only work-around for this is to unlink and create a new Proposal Hierarchy with the correct PI or have the role assignment changed by DB Admin.
  * MITKC-2033
  * ISSUE #2
  * STE upon trying to unlink the child proposal after changing the PI from Hanlon to Eagle, now Eagle as Co-I in parent and PI in only child:

* Warn user during PD budget import if effective rate start date changes

  * When importing PD budget line items into award, it is possible for the effective start dates of rates to change based on the effective salary dates of persons imported. This change displays a warning to the user when this occurs so they can take approiate action related to rates that may now need to be synced.

* Fixing base calculation.
  * The PD Budget Print > "2 Budget Cumulative Report" & "4 Budget Summary Report" had previously been fixed and passed testing.
  * Now, several issues have returned.
  * In both print reports, in the Calculation Methodology "Allocated Administrative Support and Lab Expense Rates and Base" section, the Bases are populating incorrectly.
  * For LA - Utilities, LA - Salaries, and LA- M&S, the bases should always be the same.
  * Now, they are printing differently the Salaries base correct and the others each wrong, even though the calculated costs are correct.
  * See attached print forms with highlighted (identical) population problems.

* RESKC-834:S2S Project-Performance: Updating performing organization does not update org NAME on S2S form

  * If the Performing Organization on a grants.gov proposal is changed, the PerformanceSite_2_0 form is updated to reflect the address and DUNS of the new organization, but the organization name is not updated.

  * Steps to reproduce:
  * 1) Create a new proposal.
  * 2) Select a grants.gov opportunity that utilizes the PerformanceSite_2_0 form (seems to be very common)
  * 3) Go to the Organization and Location page, and click the 'Select Different Organization' button on the Performing Organization tab.
  * 4) Select an organization other than the applicant organization (which is the default) and save the changes
  * 5) Go to the S2S -> Forms page and generate a PDF for the PerformanceSite_2_0 form.
  * 6) The "Project/Performance Site Primary Location" section will list the organization name of the original performing organization, but the DUNS/address/congressional district of the new one.

* RESKC-1097: In Proposal Dev, Proposal Hierarchy Parent Budget cost share lines are being duplicated in Institutional Commitments.

  * In Proposal Dev, Proposal Hierarchy Parent Budget cost share lines are being duplicated in Institutional Commitments > Cost Sharing when the Hierarchy > Sync All action is taken at the parent budget level.

  * Each time the sync is performed, additional lines are pulled into the distribution screen, rather than the existing ones being updated (or all deleted then written anew from the child budgets upon sync).

  * This does NOT happen when the Budget > Hierarchy > Sync to parent action is taken from an individual child. However, there are scenarios when it is not feasible to sync individually from each child rather than from the parent, particularly when children are from different units with different aggregators.

*Desired result:*
  * Syncing All from Hierarchy Parent Budget should not add new rows to those already existing at the parent budget Commitments - Cost Sharing.
  * Sync All from Parent Budget should remove all existing rows replace with the current rows from each child proposal budget with cost sharing commitments entered.

  * Steps to reproduce:

  * Create a 2 year proposal with basic information
  * Key person: PI
  * Create a Budget: add non-personnel line item at $1000, in Details, add same $1000 amount in the Cost Sharing field. Unclick the "Apply Inflation" for the line item.
  * Autogenerate periods.
  * On Commitments > Cost Sharing, enter source account as "1234567" in a row for each year for the $1000 direct costs; leave unit number blank and percentage at 0% (MIT does not usually use).
  * Add an additional row for each period for the F&A amount ($5,600 at in MIT KC WKLy): enter source account as 1402600 (all MIT uses this account for Cost Sharing F&A); leave unit number blank and percentage at 0%
  * Complete the budget.
  * Return to the proposal >
  * Toolbar > Hierarchy > create a parent with this proposal as sub-budget. Make note of the parent proposal number.
  * Toolbar > Copy > copy this proposal including the budget.

  * In the new proposal > toolbar > budget versions >Open the budget.
  * In the cost sharing distribution, change the source account for the direct costs lines for each year to "7654321".
  * Save and mark the budget as for submission and complete. (it is identical to first proposal, except for the Cost sharing direct cost source code).
  * Make a note of this child #2 proposal number.
  * Save and close proposal.

  * Open the Parent proposal .
  * Proposal Details > Toolbar > Hierarchy >  select sub-budget, enter second child proposal number and click Link a child to this Parent> Link a child to this Parent.
  * Open Budget.
  * Note Cost Sharing total by year in Periods and Totals.
  * Go to Commitments > Cost Sharing > Summary. Ensure same as the P&T amounts.
  * Note number of lines in distribution.
  * Still in budget -  Toolbar > Hierarchy >  Sync All.

  * Return to Commitments > Cost Sharing -- note that number of lines has increased, but Summary total has remained the same as have P&T total cost sharing.

  * Try to mark Budget Complete -- error regarding need to allocate all cost sharing funds will be received.

  * Turn on Validations - same error will be received.

  * Try Sync All again - it does not fix the problem but brings in yet more duplicate rows.

  * The validation needs to be changed from requiring budget start and end dates to match the proposal start and end dates to instead enforcing that the budget start date falls after the proposal start date and the budget end date falls before the proposal period end date.

* RESKC-908: It's not possible to delete a subaward from a PD budget that has any costs associated with it.

  * The steps are as follows:
  * 1) Create a new proposal.
  * 2) Create a new detailed budget within the proposal.
  * 3) Go to the Subaward panel within the budget and click "Add subaward".
  * 4) Select an organization and click Add Subaward.
  * 5) Click the Details button on the subaward and fill out the Direct/F&A costs for the subaward, then click "Save Changes".
  * 6) Back on the Subaward screen, click the Delete button to attempt to remove the subaward.
  * 7) A blank screen is displayed. (On my dev instance I got a stack trace indicating "integrity constraint (KCSO.FK2_BUDGET_DETAILS) violated")
  * 8) Navigate back to the proposal and open the budget again. The subaward is still present and has not been deleted.

*  RESKC-1058: The subrecipient DUNS number needs to display on screen near the other FAIN information related to Uniform Guidance to ease reporting.

  * The field for subrecpient's display of name was not large enough to accomodate the DUNS as well. Therefore, we should move that field to the bottom of the section so that the area can expand to show the DUNS and subrecipient name in one location. This would seperate the Subrecipient from the Sub Investigator however, so we also require that the sub Investigator move to be directly above the new subrecipient display placement. To do that, we will move the execution date to the former placement of the subrecipient.

* PD - COI Disclosure Status button and Window should display if logic requires certification

  * This is a business process requirement.
  * The COI Disclosure status button and window should display if any and all logic triggers the requirement for any proposal person to certify (sponsor hierarchy, PCK flag, proposal types, etc).
  * The button should display when personnel are added to the proposal.
  * When opened the window should remain unpopulated unless and until a proposal person answers with a Yes to one of the COI screening questions in proposal certifications maintained in PROP_PERSON_COI_CERTIFY_QID.

  * Currently the COI Disclosure status button will not display until a person has answered a yes to one of the COI screening questions in proposal certifications. Showing no COI Disclosure Status button is confusing as could mean no requirement for certification by logic or by a persons answers. The window should display if logic requires certification by any proposal persons.

* PD - Inactive COI Notification based on answers still generating

  * Confirmed the PD notification 10407 "Notification based on answers to the COI screening questions" was not Active in MITQA.
  * Created PD 30523 added personnel. Backdoor logged in as co-Investigator user mgb who answered Yes to all three COI screening questions. We got the on screen prompt modal instructing user to disclose in Coeus lite. And the attached email notification was generated to mgb stating user must complete a full disclosure before proposal can be routed.

  * Since this notification is not active it should not generate.

While this may be a correct validation for the NSF forms, the SF 424R&R allows up to 75 characters in Agency Routing Number field 4b where this data is mapping.

* IP & Award: System is allowing users to edit prior document versions when a later version of the document exists.

  * The system is allowing users to edit prior Institutional and Award document Versions but it does not pull in the data from the latest finalized version.

  * For example, in the Institutional Proposal module, if I edit an IP record - the correct Version number gets assigned regardless of what version I click the [edit] button in. However, I noticed that the information in the newly created version pulls in from the IP version I have clicked the [edit] button in and NOT from the latest finalized IP version that exists. (SAME IS HAPPENING IN THE AWARD).

  * For example, let's assume I have an IP that has a latest finalized Version 3 with title 'Kat - Version 3'. I edit that version to create Version 4 with title 'Kat - Version 4' and finalize that. I then go back to Version 3 and I edit that version, KC will assign the correct Version number (Version 5), however, the title that will pull in will be 'Kat - Version 3' and not 'Kat - Version 4'.

  * If a user jots down a doc number – they won’t look to see if a later version exists so we will run into wrong data being pulled into the IPs and Awards. To avoid this problem, the system should only allow users to EDIT the LATEST FINALIZED VERSION. Prior document versions should NOT have an [edit] button.
