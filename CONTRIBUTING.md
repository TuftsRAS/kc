# Contributing to Kuali Research

## Our Development Process
Our team of developers all work directly with an internal private repository. This repository is continuously deployed and tested. Builds are frequently pushed to hosted customers. master is our default branch and should always be in a deployable and production ready state.

## Release Numbers and Tagging
Kuali practices agile developent and continuous delivery. Semantic versioning no longer makes sense. Releases have a version following the format YYMM.buildNumber. The monthly releases are tagged using that version number. The first of these monthly releases was tagged as coeus-1504.0003.


## Pull Requests
The Kuali Research developers monitor pull requests submitted against the kualico/kc and associated repositories. Each PR is reviewed to ensure the changes are functionally acceptable and follow current standards all Kuali Devs follow. These standards include, but are not limited too;
* Clean Code - code should be easy to follow and understand, avoid duplication and be easily maintainable
* Tests - all code should be tested as much as is possible. We understand some of the current system is difficult to test, but we expect every reasonable effort to be made to test all modified and new code.
* Accessible - all new features must be accessible and comply with WCAG
* Secure - all code must be deemed to be secure

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure you have done the following
* Fork the kualico/kc repo or update your fork and then create a feature branch from the current master. We will only accept changes that work against the current main line version of the code.
* Tests are required for all changes. Testing in the current system can be difficult, but we expect contributors to make every effort to provide tests around bug fixes and additional functionality.
* All contributions should make every effort to be accessible. We will review and work with contributors to ensure this is true before accepting contributions.
* All code changes must be deemed to be secure and follow common web development security standards. For examples see [OWASP top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10).
* If your changes include functionality that might require documentation please add or link to it so it can be included in the product documentation.
* If your changes are fixing a bug, you must include all steps required to reproduce the bug. If the bug is not reproducable in Kuali's demo environment, include likely reasons for this (data, local setup, etc). We are unlikely to accept a bug fix for a bug we cannot easily validate. Tests exercising the bug can help with this.
* All database changes must follow the documentation included in the (coeus-db/coeus-db-sql/README.md).
* All api changes must be backwards compatible or versioned, fully documented and all changes and new service dependencies must be documented in (CHANGELOG_API.md).
* Ensure the existing tests pass. This must include the full suite of Unit and Integration tests.
* Finally if you havenâ€™t already done so, sign and submit a CLA with Kuali.

See the [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) for additional review steps we take with all PRs. Following this list during development and while preparing a PR will assist us in being able to quickly accept your contribution.

During a PR review our developers will frequently request changes from the author. These changes should be completed in a timely manner allowing our developers to avoid re-reviewing PRs across weeks of time. Assuming the changes necessary are minimal, our developers may, at their own discretion, make those changes themselves and merge the resulting code. In such cases the original PR may be closed with a comment referencing the resulting commit.

## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")
In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need to do this once, but we cannot accept any part of a PR until we have the CLA on file.

# Functional Standards
## Introduction
The following standards outline at a high level the expectations of Kuali and the community subcommittees. Contributions to the Kuali codebase should follow these standards in order to maintain the highest level of UI quality possible in the product.  These standards are meant to be broad principles that could apply to a wide variety of contributions without stymieing the process of bringing new features into the application.  Each standard in this document is based on experience with a given contribution.  Additional standards may be added as we gain more experience with the contribution process.  This should both guide schools who want to contribute code, Kuali when they are deciding how to integrate contributed features, and subcommittee co-chairs when reviewing contributions and requesting revisions to contributed functionality.

## Standard 1 - Naming and Terminology
Contributions will use existing terminology for elements which mirror functionality that exists elsewhere in the application.  Where possible they will remain consistent with terminology within the module the functionality is enhancing.  If there is no similar terminology within the applicable module then enhancements will be consistent with terminology from other KC modules.

## Standard 2 - User Interface/User Interaction
Contributions will be built to utilize common user interactions that exist in the system and have been set as standards for future functionality.  Until all the modules are re-written and have the same interaction model, enhancements will honor the existing user interactions for the module they are a part of.  If a contribution is specifically designed to improve on the existing interface model it will be built to avoid UI regressions where possible.

## Standard 3 - Existing Fields
Contributions will not repurpose existing fields in ways that are inconsistent with their current design.
